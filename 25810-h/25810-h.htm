<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p>High noon at Talbot&#8217;s Cross-roads, with the mercury
standing at ninety-eight in the shade&mdash;though there was
not much shade worth mentioning in the immediate vicinity
of the Cross-roads post-office, about which, upon the occasion
referred to, the few human beings within sight and sound
were congregated. There were trees enough a few hundred
yards away, but the post-office stood boldly and unflinchingly
in the blazing sun. The roads crossing each other stretched
themselves as far as the eye could follow them, the red clay
transformed into red dust which even an ordinarily lively
imagination might have fancied was red hot. The shrill,
rattling cry of the grasshoppers, hidden in the long yellow
sedge-grass and drouth-smitten corn, pierced the stillness
now and then with a suddenness startling each time it broke
forth, because the interval between each of the pipings was
given by the hearers to drowsiness or heated unconscious
naps.
</p>
<p>In such napping and drowsiness the present occupants
of the post-office were indulging. Upon two empty goods
boxes two men in copperas-coloured jean garments reclined
in easy attitudes, their hats tilted over their eyes, while several
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
others balanced their split-seated chairs against the
house or the post-porch and dozed.
</p>
<p>Inside the store the postmaster and proprietor tilted his
chair against the counter and dozed also, though fitfully, and
with occasional restless changes of position and smothered
maledictions against the heat. He was scarcely the build of
man to sleep comfortably at high noon in midsummer. His
huge, heavy body was rather too much for him at any time,
but during the hot weather he succumbed beneath the weight
of his own flesh. Hamlin County knew him as &#8220;Big Tom
D&#8217;Willerby,&#8221; and, indeed, rather prided itself upon him as
a creditable possession. It noted any increase in his weight,
repeated his jokes, and bore itself patiently under his satire.
His indolence it regarded with leniency not entirely untinged
with secret exultation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>The</i> derndest, laziest critter,&#8221; his acquaintances would
remark to each other; &#8220;the <i>derndest</i> I do reckon that ever
the Lord made. Nigh unto three hundred he weighs, and
never done a lick o&#8217; work in his life. Not one! Lord, no!
Tom D&#8217;Willerby work? I guess not. He gits on fine without
any o&#8217; that in his&#8217;n. Work ain&#8217;t his kind. It&#8217;s a pleasin&#8217;
sight to see him lyin&#8217; round thar to the post-office an&#8217; the
boys a-waitin&#8217; on to him, doin&#8217; his tradin&#8217; for him, an&#8217; sortin&#8217;
the mail when it comes in. They&#8217;re ready enough to do it
jest to hear him gas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And so they were. About eight years before the time the
present story commences, he had appeared upon the scene
apparently having no object in view but to make himself
as comfortable as possible. He took up his quarters at one
of the farm-houses among the mountains, paid his hostess
regularly for the simple accommodations she could afford
him, and, before three months passed, had established his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
reputation and, without making the slightest apparent effort,
had gathered about him a large circle of friends and admirers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His name&#8217;s D&#8217;Willerby,&#8221; Mrs. Pike would drawl when
questioned about him, &#8220;an&#8217; he&#8217;s kin to them D&#8217;Willerbys
that&#8217;s sich big bugs down to D&#8217;Lileville. I guess they ain&#8217;t
much friendly, though. He don&#8217;t seem to like to have nothin&#8217;
much to say about &#8217;em. Seems like he has money a-plenty
to carry him along, an&#8217; he talks some o&#8217; settin&#8217; up a store
somewhars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the course of a month or so he carried out the plan,
selecting Talbot&#8217;s Cross-roads as the site for the store in
question. He engaged hands to erect a frame building,
collected by the assistance of some mysterious agency a
heterogeneous stock consisting of calicoes, tinware, coffee,
sugar, tobacco, and various waif and stray commodities, and,
having done so, took his seat on the porch one morning and
announced the establishment open.
</p>
<p>Upon the whole, the enterprise was a success. Barnesville
was fifteen miles distant, and the farmers, their wives and
daughters, were glad enough to stop at the Cross-roads for
their calico dresses and store-coffee. By doing so they were
saved a long ride and gained superior conversational advantages.
&#8220;D&#8217;Willerby&#8217;s mighty easy to trade with,&#8221; it was
said.
</p>
<p>There was always a goodly number of &#8220;critters&#8221; tied to
the fence-corners, and consequently to business was added
the zest of society and the interchanging of gossip. &#8220;D&#8217;Willerby&#8217;s&#8221;
became a centre of interest and attraction, and
D&#8217;Willerby himself a county institution.
</p>
<p>Big Tom, however, studiously avoided taking a too active
part in the duties of the establishment. Having with great
forethought provided himself with a stout chair which could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
be moved from behind the counter to the door, and from
the door to the store as the weather demanded, he devoted
himself almost exclusively to sitting in it and encouraging
a friendly and accommodating spirit in his visitors and admirers.
The more youthful of those admirers he found useful
in the extreme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;a man can&#8217;t do more than a
thousand things at once. A man can&#8217;t talk a steady stream
and do himself justice, and settle the heftiest kind of questions,
and say the kind of things these ladies ought to have
said to &#8217;em, and then measure out molasses and weigh coffee
and slash off calico dresses and trade for eggs. Some of
you&#8217;ve got to roust out and do some clerking, or I&#8217;ve got
to quit. I&#8217;ve not got the constitution to stand it. Jim, you
&#8217;tend to Mis&#8217; Pike, and Bill, you wait on Mis&#8217; Jones. Lord!
Lord! half a dozen of you here, and not one doing a thing&mdash;not
a derned thing! Do you want me to get up and leave
Miss Mirandy and do things myself? We&#8217;ve got to settle
about the colour of this gown. How&#8217;d you feel now, if it
wasn&#8217;t becoming to her complexion? Just help yourself
to that plug of tobacco, Hance, and lay your ten cents in
the cash drawer, and then you can weigh out that butter of
Mis&#8217; Simpson&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When there was a prospect of a post-office at the Cross-roads,
there was only one opinion as to who was the man best
calculated to adorn the position of postmaster.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The store&#8217;s right yere, Tom,&#8221; said his patrons, &#8220;an&#8217;
you&#8217;re right yere. Ye can write and spell off things &#8217;thout
any trouble, an&#8217; I reckon ye wouldn&#8217;t mind the extry two
dollars comin&#8217; in ev&#8217;ry month.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord! Lord!&#8221; groaned Tom, who was stretched full
length on the floor of the porch when the subject was first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
broached. &#8220;Do you want a man to kill himself out an&#8217; out,
boys? Work himself into eternal kingdom come? Who&#8217;d
do the extra work, I&#8217;d like to know&mdash;empty out the mail-bag
and hand out the mail, and do the extra cussin&#8217;? That
would be worth ten dollars a month. And, like as not, the
money would be paid in cheques, and who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to sign
&#8217;em? Lord! I believe you think a man&#8217;s immortal soul
could be bought for fifty cents a day. You don&#8217;t allow for
the wear and tear on a fellow&#8217;s constitution, boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But he allowed himself to be placed in receipt of the
official salary in question, and the matter of extra labour
settled itself. Twice a week a boy on horseback brought
the mail-bag from Barnesville, and when this youth drew
rein before the porch Big Tom greeted him from indoors
with his habitual cordiality.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Light, sonny, &#8217;light!&#8221; he would call out in languidly
sonorous tones; &#8220;come in and let these fellows hear the
news. Just throw that mail-bag on the counter and let&#8217;s
hear from you. Plenty of good water down at the spring.
Might as well take that bucket and fill it if you want a drink.
I&#8217;ve been waiting for just such a man as you to do it. These
fellows would sit here all day and let a man die. I can&#8217;t get
anything out of &#8217;em. I&#8217;ve about half a mind to quit sometimes
and leave them to engineer the thing themselves. Look
here now, is any fellow going to attend to that mail, or is
it going to lie there till I have to get up and attend to
it myself? I reckon that&#8217;s what you want. I reckon that&#8217;d
just suit you. Jehoshaphat! I guess you&#8217;d like me to take
charge of the eternal universe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was for the mail he waited with his usual complement
of friends and assistants on the afternoon referred to at the
opening of this chapter. The boy was behind time, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
under the influence of the heat, conversation had at first
flagged and then subsided. Big Tom himself had taken
the initiative of dropping into a doze, and his companions
had one by one followed his example, or at least made an
effort at doing so. The only one of the number who remained
unmistakably awake was a little man who sat on
the floor of the end of the porch, his small legs, encased
in large blue jean pantaloons, dangling over the side. This
little man, who was gently and continuously ruminating,
with brief &#8220;asides&#8221; of expectoration, kept his eyes fixed
watchfully upon the Barnesville Road, and he it was who
at last roused the dozers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s some un a-comin&#8217;,&#8221; he announced in a meek voice.
&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Big Tom opened his eyes, stretched himself, and gradually
rose in his might, proving a very tight fit for the establishment,
especially the doorway, towards which he lounged,
supporting himself against its side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it, Ezra?&#8221; he asked, almost extinguishing the
latter cognomen with a yawn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s thet thar feller!&#8221;
</p>
<p>All the other men awakened in a body. Whomsoever the
individual might be, he had the power to rouse them to
a lively exhibition of interest. One and all braced themselves
to look at the horseman approaching along the Barnesville
Road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a kinder curi&#8217;s-lookin&#8217; feller,&#8221; observed one philosopher.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, at a distance of half a mile, perhaps he is,&#8221; said
Tom. &#8220;In a cloud of dust and the sun blazin&#8217; down on him
like thunderation, I don&#8217;t know but you&#8217;re right, Nath.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Git out!&#8221; replied Nath, placidly. &#8220;He&#8217;s a curi&#8217;s-actin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
feller, anyway. Don&#8217;t go nowhar nor hev nothin&#8217; to say
to nobody. Jest sets right down in that thar holler with
his wife, as if b&#8217;ars an&#8217; painters wus all a man or woman
wanted round &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a doggoned purty critter,&#8221; said the little man in
large trousers, placidly. He had not appeared to listen to
the conversation, but, as this pertinent remark proved, it
had not been lost on him.
</p>
<p>His observation was greeted with a general laugh, which
seemed to imply that the speaker had a character which his
speech sustained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whar did ye see her, Stamps?&#8221; was asked.
</p>
<p>The little man remained unmoved, still dangling his legs
over the porch side, still ruminating, still gazing with pale,
blinking eyes up the road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Went over the mountain to &#8217;tend court to Bakersville,
an&#8217; took it on my road to go by thar. She was settin&#8217; in
the door, an&#8217; I see her afore she seen me. When she hearn
the sound of my mule&#8217;s feet, she got up an&#8217; went into the
house. It was a powerful hot mornin&#8217;, &#8216;n&#8217; I wus mighty dry,
&#8216;n&#8217; I stopped fur a cool drink. She didn&#8217;t come out when
fust I hollered, &#8216;n&#8217; when she did come, she looked kinder
skeered &#8216;n&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t talk none. Kep&#8217; her sunbonnet over
her face, like she didn&#8217;t want to be seen overmuch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does she look like, Ezry?&#8221; asked one of the
younger men.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps meditated a few seconds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look like none o&#8217; the women folk about yere,&#8221; he
replied, finally. &#8220;She ain&#8217;t their kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean by that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno eggsactly. She&#8217;s mighty white &#8216;n&#8217; young-lookin&#8217;
&#8216;n&#8217; delicate&mdash;but that ain&#8217;t all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>Tom made a restless movement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, boys,&#8221; he broke in, suddenly, &#8220;here&#8217;s a nice
business&mdash;a lot of fellows asking questions about a woman
an&#8217; gossiping as if there wasn&#8217;t a thing better to do. Leave
&#8217;em alone, if they want to be left alone&mdash;leave &#8217;em alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps expectorated in an entirely unbiased manner.
He seemed as willing to leave his story alone as he had been
to begin it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s comin&#8217; yere,&#8221; he said, softly, after a pause. &#8220;Thet&#8217;s
whar he&#8217;s comin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rest of the company straightened themselves in their
seats and made an effort to assume the appearance of slightly
interested spectators. It became evident that Mr. Stamps
was right, and that the rider was about to dismount.
</p>
<p>He was a man about thirty years of age, thin, narrow-chested,
and stooping. His coarse clothes seemed specially
ill-suited to his slender figure, his black hair was long, and
his beard neglected; his broad hat was pulled low over his
eyes and partially concealed his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t look none too sociable when he&#8217;s nigher than
half a mile,&#8221; remarked Nath in an undertone.
</p>
<p>He glanced neither to the right nor to the left as he strode
past the group into the store. Strange to relate, Tom had
lounged behind the counter and stood ready to attend him.
He asked for a few necessary household trifles in a low tone,
and, as Tom collected and made them into a clumsy package,
he stood and looked on with his back turned towards the
door.
</p>
<p>Those gathered upon the porch listened eagerly for the
sound of conversation, but none reached their ears. Tom
moved heavily to and fro for a few minutes, and then the
parcel was handed across the counter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hot weather,&#8221; said the stranger, without raising his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;hot weather, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-day,&#8221; said the stranger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-day,&#8221; answered Tom.
</p>
<p>And his customer took his departure. He passed out as
he had passed in; but while he was indoors little Mr. Stamps
had changed his position. He now sat near the wooden steps,
his legs dangling as before, his small countenance as noncommittal
as ever. As the stranger neared him, he raised
his pale little eyes, blinked them, indulged in a slight jerk
of the head, and uttered a single word of greeting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger started, glanced down at him, and walked on.
He made no answer, untied his horse, mounted it, and rode
back over the Barnesville Road towards the mountain.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps remained seated near the steps and blinked
after him silently until he was out of sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye didn&#8217;t seem to talk none, D&#8217;Willerby,&#8221; said one of
the outsiders when Tom reappeared.
</p>
<p>Tom sank into his chair, thrust his hands into his pockets,
and stretched his limbs out to their fullest capacity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let a man rest, boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;let a man rest!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was silent for some time afterwards, and even on the
arrival of the mail was less discursive than usual. It was
Mr. Stamps who finally aroused him from his reverie.
</p>
<p>Having obtained his mail&mdash;one letter in a legal-looking
envelope&mdash;and made all other preparations to return to the
bosom of his family, Stamps sidled up to the counter, and,
leaning over it, spoke in an insinuatingly low tone:
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was bar&#8217;foot,&#8221; he said, mildly, &#8220;&#8216;n&#8217; she hadn&#8217;t been
raised to it&mdash;that was one thing. Her feet wus as soft &#8216;n&#8217;
tender as a baby&#8217;s; &#8216;n&#8217; fur another thing, her hands wus
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
as white as her face, &#8216;n&#8217; whiter. Thet ain&#8217;t the way we raise
&#8217;em in Hamlin County&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And, having said it, he slipped out of the store, mounted
his mule, and jogged homeward on the Barnesville Road
also.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p>Before the war there were no people better known or
more prominent in their portion of the State than the De
Willoughbys of Delisle County, Tennessee. To have been
born a De Willoughby was, in general opinion, to have been
born with a silver spoon in one&#8217;s mouth. It was indeed to
have been born to social dignity, fortune, courage, and more
than the usual allowance of good looks. And though the
fortune was lavishly spent, the courage sometimes betrayed
into a rather theatrical dare-deviltry, and the good looks
prone to deteriorate in style, there was always the social position
left, and this was a matter of the deepest importance
in Delisleville. The sentiments of Delisleville were purely
patrician. It was the county town, and contained six thousand
inhabitants, two hotels, and a court-house. It had also
two or three business streets and half a dozen churches, all
very much at odds with each other and each seriously inclined
to disbelieve in the probable salvation of the rest.
The &#8220;first families&#8221; (of which there were eight or ten, with
numerous branches) attended the Episcopal Church, the second
best the Presbyterian, while the inferior classes, who
could scarcely be counted at all, since they had not been
born in Delisleville, drifted to the Methodists.
</p>
<p>The De Willoughbys attended the Episcopal Church, and,
being generally endowed with voices, two or three of them
sang in the choir, which was composed entirely of members
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
of the attending families and executed most difficult music
in a manner which was the cause after each service of much
divided opinion. Opinion was divided because the choir was
divided&mdash;separated, in fact, into several small, select cliques,
each engaged in deadly and bitter feud with the rest. When
the moon-eyed soprano arose, with a gentle flutter, and
opened her charming mouth in solo, her friends settled
themselves in their pews with a general rustle of satisfaction,
while the friends of the contralto exchanged civilly significant
glances; and on the way home the solo in question was
disposed of in a manner at once thorough and final. The
same thing occurred when the contralto was prominent, or
the tenor, or the baritone, or the basso, each of whom it was
confidently asserted by competent Delisleville judges might
have rendered him or herself and Delisleville immortal
upon the lyric stage if social position had not placed the
following of such a profession entirely out of the question.
There had indeed been some slight trouble in one or two
of the best families, occasioned by the musical fervour of
youthful scions who were in danger of being led into indiscretions
by their enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>The De Willoughbys occupied one of the most prominent
pews in the sacred edifice referred to. Judge De Willoughby,
a large, commanding figure, with a fine sweep of long hair,
mustache and aquiline profile; Mrs. De Willoughby (who
had been a Miss Vanuxem of South Carolina), slender, willowy,
with faded brunette complexion and still handsome
brunette eyes, and three or four little De Willoughbys, all
more or less pretty and picturesque. These nearly filled the
pew. The grown-up Misses De Willoughby sang with two
of their brothers in the choir. There were three sons, Romaine,
De Courcy, and Thomas. But Thomas did not sing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
in the choir. Thomas, alas! did not sing at all. Thomas,
it was universally conceded by every De Willoughby of the
clan, was a dismal failure. Even from his earliest boyhood,
when he had been a huge, overgrown fellow, whose only
redeeming qualities were his imperturbable good-humor and
his ponderous wit, his family had regarded him with a sense
of despair. In the first place, he was too big. His brothers
were tall, lithe-limbed youths, who were graceful, dark-eyed,
dark-haired, and had a general air of brilliancy. They figured
well at college and in their world; they sang and danced
in a manner which, combining itself with the name of De
Willoughby, gave them quite an ennobled sort of distinction,
a touch of patrician bravado added to their picturesqueness
in the eyes of the admiring; and their little indiscretions
were of a nature to be ignored or treated with gentle consideration
as the natural result of their youth, spirit, and
Southern blood. But at nineteen Thomas had attained a
height of six feet five, with a proportionate breadth and
ponderousness. His hands and feet were a disgrace to a De
Willoughby, and his voice was a roar when he was influenced
by anything like emotion. Displays of emotion, however,
were but rare occurrences with him. He was too lazy to be
roused to anger or any other violent feeling. He spent his
leisure hours in lying upon sofas or chairs and getting very
much in everybody&#8217;s way. He lounged through school and
college without the slightest <i>éclat</i> attending his progress.
</p>
<p>It became the pastime of the household to make rather
a butt of him, and for the most part he bore himself under
the difficulties of his position peaceably enough, though
there had been times when his weighty retorts had caused
some sharp wincing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an ill-natured devil, Tom,&#8221; his brother De
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
Courcy said to him, as he stood fingering the ornaments
on the mantel after one such encounter. &#8220;You&#8217;re an ill-natured
devil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom was stretched on a sofa, with his big hands under
his head, and did not condescend to look around.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not such a thundering fool as you take me for, that&#8217;s
all,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got my eyes open. Keep to your
side of the street, and I will keep to mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was true that he had his eyes open and had more wit
and feeling than they gave him credit for. No one understood
him, not even his mother, who had deplored him from
the first hour of his overweighted babyhood, when she had
given him over to the care of his negro nurse in despair.
</p>
<p>In the midst of a large family occupied with all the small
gaieties attendant upon popularity and social distinction in
a provincial town, he lived a lonely life, and one not without
its pathetic side if it had been so looked upon. But even
he himself had never regarded the matter from a sentimental
point of view. He endeavoured to resign himself to his fate
and meet it philosophically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t cut out for this sort of thing, boys,&#8221; he had
said to his friends at college, where he had been rather popular.
&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t cut out for it. Go ahead and leave me
behind. I&#8217;m not a bad sort of fellow, but there is too much
of me in one way and too little in another. What the Lord
made such a man as me for after six thousand years&#8217; experience,
I haven&#8217;t found out yet. A man may as well make up
his mind about himself first as last. I&#8217;ve made up mine and
nobody differs from me so far as I&#8217;ve gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he left college his brothers had already chosen their
vocations. Delisle County knew them as promising young
lawyers, each having distinguished himself with much fiery
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
eloquence in an occasional case. The cases had not always
been gained, but the fervour and poetry of the appeals to
the rather muddled and startled agriculturists who formed
the juries were remembered with admiration and as being
worthy of Delisleville, and were commented upon in the
Delisleville <i>Oriflamme</i> as the &#8220;fit echoings of an eloquence
long known in our midst as the birthright of those bearing
one of our proudest names, an eloquence spurred to its eagle
flights by the warm, chivalric blood of a noble race.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the &#8220;warm, chivalric blood&#8221; of the race in question
seemed to move but slowly in veins of its most substantial
representative. The inertness of his youngest son roused
that fine old Southern gentleman and well-known legal dignitary,
Judge De Willoughby, to occasional outbursts of the
fiery eloquence before referred to which might well have
been productive of remarkable results.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God, sir!&#8221; he would trumpet forth, &#8220;good God,
sir! have we led the State for generation after generation
to be disgraced and degraded and dragged in the dust by
one of our own stock at last? The De Willoughbys have
been gentlemen, sir, distinguished at the bar, in politics,
and in the highest social circles of the South; and here we
have a De Willoughby whose tastes would be no credit to&mdash;to
his overseer, a De Willoughby who has apparently neither
the ambition nor the qualification to shine in the sphere in
which he was born! Blow your damned brains out, if you
have any; blow your damned brains out, and let&#8217;s have an
end of the whole disgraceful business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This referred specially to Tom&#8217;s unwillingness to enter
upon the study of medicine, which had been chosen for
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should make a better farmer,&#8221; he said, bitterly, after
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
a prolonged discussion. &#8220;I&#8217;m not the build for women&#8217;s
bedrooms and children&#8217;s bedsides. De Courcy would have
suited you better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;De Courcy is a gentleman&mdash;a gentleman, sir! He was
born one and would shine in any profession a gentleman
may adorn. As for you, this is the only thing left for you,
and you shall try it, by G&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try it. I can only fail, and I&#8217;ve
done that before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did try it forthwith, applying himself to his studies
with a persistence quite creditable. He read lying upon
sofas and lounging in the piazzas, and in course of time was
sent to attend lectures in Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>Whether he could have gained his diploma or not was
never decided. Those of the professors who commented on
him at all, spoke of him as slow but persevering, and regarded
him rather as a huge receiving machine of orderly
habits. The Judge began to congratulate himself upon his
determination, and his mother thought it &#8220;a good thing
poor Tom was disposed of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But one terrible morning just before the first course of
lectures was completed, he suddenly returned, walking into
the Judge&#8217;s office without any previous intimation of his
intention.
</p>
<p>When he turned in his seat and confronted him, the Judge
lost his breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;I&#8217;ve come back.&#8221; He was rather pale
and nervous, but there was a dogged, resigned look in his
eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made up my mind,&#8221; he added, &#8220;that I cannot
stand it. Turn me loose on one of your plantations to&mdash;to
boss niggers. You said once I was fit for an overseer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
Perhaps you weren&#8217;t wrong. Say the word and I&#8217;ll start
to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Judge&#8217;s aquiline countenance turned gray with fury.
His fine mustache seemed to curl itself anew.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you accursed scoundrel!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;You accursed,
underbred hound! Tell me what this means, or I&#8217;ll
strangle you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll say I&#8217;m a fool,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;and I suppose it&#8217;s
true, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; with a tremour in his voice, &#8220;I&#8217;ve no
need to be particular about the names you call me. I ought
to be used to them by this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak out,&#8221; thundered the Judge, &#8220;and tell me the
whole disgraceful truth!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t take long,&#8221; said Tom; &#8220;I told it when I said
I&#8217;d made up my mind I couldn&#8217;t stand it. I&#8217;ve been walking
the hospitals and attending the clinics for the last three
months, and I&#8217;ve had a chance to see what my life would
be if I went through. I&#8217;ve seen things to make a man
tremble when they came back to him in the dead of night&mdash;agony
and horror&mdash;women and children! Good Lord! I
can&#8217;t tell you. De Courcy could, but I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;d rather
be in hell than live such a life day after day. I tried to
stand up against it at first. I thought I might get used to
it, but I haven&#8217;t the nerve&mdash;or something was wrong. It
got worse and worse, until I used to start up out of my sleep
in a cold sweat, hearing screams and groans and prayers.
That was the worst of all&mdash;their prayers to us to help them
and not to hurt them. Four days ago a child was brought
in&mdash;a child four or five years old. There was an operation
to be performed, and I was the man chosen to hold it still.
Its mother was sent out of the room. My God! how it
screamed when it saw her go and knew it was to be left
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
to us. They told me to hold it because I was the strongest,
and&mdash;and I put my hands on it. I&#8217;m a big fellow to look
at, and I suppose it knew there was no help for it when
I came near. It turned as white as death and looked up
at me with the tears streaming down its face. Before the
operation was half over it hadn&#8217;t the strength left to scream
or struggle, and it lay and looked at me and moaned. I
should have given up the job, but somehow I couldn&#8217;t make
up my mind to&mdash;to leave it. When it was all done, I gave
it back to its mother and went to my rooms. I turned sick
on the way and had to sit down to rest. I swore then I&#8217;d
let the thing drop, and I bought my ticket and came back.
I&#8217;m not the man for the work. Better men may do it&mdash;perhaps
it takes better men. I&#8217;m not up to it.&#8221; And his
shaken voice broke as he hung his great head.
</p>
<p>A deadly calm settled upon the Judge. He pointed to
the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go home to your mother, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve done with
you. Go and stay with the women. That&#8217;s the place for
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a coward as well as a fool,&#8221; he said afterwards in
the bosom of his family; &#8220;a white-livered fool who hasn&#8217;t
the nerve to look at a sick child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a terrible day for the household, but at last it was
over. Tom went to his room in an apathy. He had been
buffeted and scorned and held up to bitter derision until
he had ceased to feel anything but a negative, helpless misery.
</p>
<p>About a week later Delia Vanuxem appeared upon the
scene. Delia Vanuxem was a young cousin of Mrs. De
Willoughby&#8217;s, and had come to pay her relatives a visit.
It was the hospitable custom of Delisleville to cultivate its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
kinsfolk&mdash;more especially its kinswomen. There were always
in two or three of the principal families young lady
guests who were during their stay in the town the sensation
of the hour. Novelty established them as temporary
belles; they were petted by their hostesses, attended by
small cohorts of admirers, and formed the centre for
a round of festivities specially arranged to enliven their
visits.
</p>
<p>Delia Vanuxem bore away the palm from all such visitors
past or to come. She was a true Southern beauty, with the
largest dark eyes, the prettiest yielding manner, and the
very smallest foot Delisleville had ever fallen prostrate before,
it being well known among her admirers that one of
her numerous male cousins had once measured her little
slipper with a cigar&mdash;a story in which Delisleville delighted.
And she was not only a pretty, but also a lovable and tender-hearted
young creature. Her soft eyes end soft voice did
not belie her. She was gentle and kindly to all around her.
Mrs. De Willoughby and the two older girls fell in love with
her at once, and the Judge himself was aroused to an eloquence
of compliment and a courtly grandeur of demeanour
which rose even beyond his usual efforts in a line in which
he had always shone. The very negroes adored her and vied
with each other to do her service.
</p>
<p>It was quite natural that a nature so sweet and sympathetic
should be awakened to pity for the one member of
the gay household who seemed cut off from the rest, and
who certainly at the time existed under a darker cloud than
usual.
</p>
<p>From the first she was more considerate of poor Tom
than anyone who had ever been before, and more than once,
as he sat silent and gloomy at the table, he looked up to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
find her lovely eyes resting upon his big frame with a questioning,
pitying glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is so much too big, Aunt Jule,&#8221; she wrote home once.
&#8220;And he seems somehow to feel as if he was always in the
way, and, indeed, he is a little sometimes, poor fellow! and
everyone appears to think he is only a joke or a mistake;
but I have made up my mind never to laugh at him at all
as the other girls do. It seems so unkind, and surely he
must feel it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She never did laugh at him, and sometimes even tried to
talk to him, and once drew him out so far in an artful, innocent
way, that he told her something of his medical failure
and the reasons for it, manifestly ashamed of the story as
he related it, and yet telling it so well in a few clumsy, rather
disconnected sentences, that when he had finished her eyelashes
were wet and she broke into a little shuddering sigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you are to blame, really.
I have often thought that I could never, never bear to do
such things, though, of course, if there was no one to do
them it would be dreadful; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;there it is. Someone must do it, and
I know I&#8217;m a confounded coward and ninny, but&mdash;but I
couldn&#8217;t.&#8221; And he looked overwhelmed with humiliation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But after all,&#8221; she said, in the soft voice which had
always the sound of appeal in it, &#8220;after all, I&#8217;m sure it was
because you have a kind heart, and a kind heart is worth
a great deal. You will do something else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing else for me to do,&#8221; he said, mournfully;
&#8220;nothing that won&#8217;t disgrace the rest, they tell me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was small wonder that this was his final undoing,
though neither was to blame. Certainly no fault could be
attached to the young creature who meant to be kind to him,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
as it was her nature to be to all surrounding her; and surely
Tom&#8217;s great and final blunder arose from no presumption
on his part. He had never thought of aspiring to the proud
position with regard to her which Romaine and De Courcy
seemed to occupy by natural right. It was only now and
then, when they were unavoidably engaged, that he had the
courage to offer his services as messenger or escort, but
even those rare pleasures were a little too much for him.
He was so unused to such privileges that they intoxicated
him and set his mind in a whirl which prevented his thinking
clearly, or, indeed, ever thinking at all sometimes.
</p>
<p>Even when it was all over, he scarcely knew how he had
been betrayed into the weakness he was guilty of. It was
not like him to lose sight of his manifold imperfections;
but for once they were swept out of his mind by a momentary
madness.
</p>
<p>It was on the occasion of a ball at the Delisle House. The
Delisle House was the principal hotel, and all important festivities
were held in its long dining-hall disguised as a ballroom.
The ball was given by a gallant Delisleville Club in
honour of Miss Delia Vanuxem, and it was a very magnificent
affair indeed. The disguise of the dining-room was
complete. It was draped with flags and decorated with
wreaths of cedar and paper roses. A band of coloured gentlemen,
whose ardour concealed any slight musical discrepancies,
assisted the festivities, which&mdash;to quote the <i>Oriflamme</i>
of the next morning&mdash;&#8220;the wealth, beauty, and chivalry of
Delisleville combined to render unequalled in their gaiety
and elegance, making the evening one of the most successful
of the piquant occasions

</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>Usually Tom&#8217;s part in such festivities was to sit uncomfortably
in dull corners, taking up as little room as possible,
or piloting his way carefully through the crowd to the supper-table
with an elderly lady or a wall-flower clinging timidly
to his huge arm. But during this one evening he lost
his equilibrium. Delia had been more than usually kind
to him, perhaps because she saw his unhappy awkwardness
as he towered above everyone else and tried to avoid treading
upon his neighbours. She gave him such a pretty smile
across the room that he obeyed the impulse to go to her and
stand at her side; then, when she left him to dance with
De Courcy, she gave him her fan and bouquet and fleecy
white wrap to hold, and somehow it seemed not unnatural
that De Courcy should bring her back to him as to a sentinel
when the dance was over. Thus it was as she sat, flushed
a little and smiling, her face uplifted to his, while she
thanked him for taking care of her possessions, that the
wild thought which so betrayed him rushed into his brain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Delia,&#8221; he faltered, &#8220;will you dance once with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was so startling a request, that, though she was quick
enough to conceal her surprise, she hesitated a second before
recovering her breath to give him her answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Tom, if you like,&#8221; she said, and glanced down at
her programme. &#8220;The next is a waltz, and I can let you
have it because Dr. Ballentine has been called away. Do
you waltz?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have learned,&#8221; he answered, rather huskily and tremulously.
&#8220;I do it badly, of course, but I know the steps
well enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was so helpless with nervousness that he could scarcely
speak, and his hands trembled when they stood up together
and he laid his arm reverently about her waist.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>She saw his timidity and looked up at him with a kind
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be very little,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I never knew before
that I was so little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had thought he should recover himself when the music
and motion began, but he did not. He looked down at the
delicate head which reached barely to his beating heart, and
a blur came before his sight; the light and the crowd of
dancers dazzled and confused him. The whirling movement
made him dizzy, and he had not expected to be dizzy. He
began suddenly to be conscious of his own immensity, the
unusualness of his position, and of the fact that here and
there he saw a meaning smile; his heart beat faster still,
and he knew he had been led into a mistake. He swung
round and round too quickly for the music, missed a step,
tried to recover himself, became entangled in his partner&#8217;s
dress, trod on her poor little feet, and fell headlong on
the floor, dragging her with him and striking against a
passing couple.
</p>
<p>It was his brother De Courcy with whom he had come
in such violent contact, and it was De Courcy who sprang
to Delia&#8217;s rescue, assisting her to her feet with all possible
grace, and covering her innocent confusion with a brilliant
speech, but not, however, before he had directed a terrible
scowl at the prostrate culprit and sworn furiously at him
under his breath. But Delia was very good to him and did
not desert him in the hour of his need, giving him only
kind looks and managing to arrange that he should lead
her to her seat as if he had not been in disgrace at all.
</p>
<p>But the shame and pain of his downfall were sharper
pangs than he had ever borne, and before the night was
half over he slipped away from the dangers and rushed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
home to his own room, where he lay awake through the
long hours, cursing himself for his folly, and tossing in
a fever of humiliation and grief.
</p>
<p>In the morning when he came down to the breakfast
table, the family were already assembled, and the Judge
had heard the story from De Courcy, who told it all the
more forcibly in the absence of Miss Vanuxem, who had
spent the night at the house of another relative.
</p>
<p>When Tom entered, his paternal parent was ready to
receive him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trod on Miss Vanuxem&#8217;s dress and tore it off her back
in the ballroom, did you?&#8221; he burst forth. &#8220;Made a fool
of yourself and a bear-garden of the Delisle House ballroom!
What were you trying to dance for? Leave that
to men who can manage their limbs, and don&#8217;t inflict yourself
on women who are too high-bred to refuse to dance
with a man who ought to be a gentleman. Stay at home,
sir! Stay at home, and don&#8217;t make a disgraceful spectacle
of yourself in public, particularly when there are lovely
women present to witness your humiliation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the figurative last straw. Tom&#8217;s mind had been
dark and gloomy enough to begin with, but when during
his father&#8217;s harangue he glanced up and saw De Courcy
bending his aquiline face over his paper with a slightly
sardonic smile, he could stand no more.
</p>
<p>To the utter dumfounding of his mother and sisters,
and even the irate Judge himself, he pushed his chair back
and sprang to his feet with an actual roar of rage and
pain. His great body seemed to swell until its size overwhelmed
them; his eyes blazed, he shook his tremendous
fist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave me alone!&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;leave me alone! Yes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
I did make a fool of myself! Yes, I did knock a woman
down and tear her dress and look like an ass and set the
whole room laughing at me, women and all&mdash;the best-bred
and sweetest of them! It&#8217;s all true, every word of it, and
more too&mdash;more too! And that&#8217;s not enough, but my own
father serves it up again, and you fellows sit there and grin
over it to make it worse. That&#8217;s right, pitch in, all of you,
and drive me mad and put an end to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He upset his chair and a small negro boy with a plate of
waffles, and, striding over the scattered ruins, dashed out
of the room with tears of fury in his eyes.
</p>
<p>It was the turning-point of his existence. He made his
bitter resolve as he walked out of the house down the
street. Early as it was, he went straight to Delia, and when
he found himself alone with her, poured forth all the
misery of his sore heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had been born a clod-hopper it would have been
better for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have no place here among men
with decently shaped bodies and clear heads. I&#8217;m a great
clumsy fool, and there&#8217;s no help for it. If I&#8217;d had more
brain, I might have managed the rest; but I&#8217;m a dullard
too. They may well sneer at me. I think I will go away
and bury myself somewhere among the people I ought to
have lived among by rights. In some simple country place
I might find those who know less than I do, and forget the
rest; and perhaps be content enough in time. I shall
never marry. I&mdash;I suppose you know that, Delia.&#8221; And
he took her little hand and laid it on his own open palm
and sat silent a moment looking at it, and at last suddenly
a great drop fell upon it which made them both start. He
did not look up at her, but took out his big white handkerchief
and wiped the drop gently away and then stooped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
and kissed the spot where it had fallen. Her own lashes
were wet when their eyes met afterwards, and she spoke in
a subdued voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always liked you very much, Cousin Tom,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t talk of going away. We should miss
you much more than you think. I know I should be very
sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be here to miss me, Delia,&#8221; he answered,
sadly.
</p>
<p>The hand on his palm trembled slightly and her eyes
faltered under his gaze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;think it&mdash;is possible I shall live in Delisleville,&#8221;
she whispered.
</p>
<p>His heart bounded as if it would burst his side. He knew
what she meant in an instant, though he had never suspected
it before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;Oh, Delia! which&mdash;which
of them is it? It&#8217;s De Courcy, I could swear. It&#8217;s De
Courcy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;it is De Courcy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew his hand away and covered his face with it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it was De Courcy,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;He was always
the kind of fellow to win. I suppose he deserves it. The
Lord knows I hope he does, for your sake. Of course it&#8217;s
De Courcy. Who else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not stay long after this, and when he went away
he wrung her hand in his in a desperate farewell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is another reason for my going now,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t stay. This&mdash;is&mdash;good-bye, Delia.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went home and had a prolonged interview with his
father. It was not an agreeable interview to recur to
mentally in after time, but in the end Tom gained his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
point, and a portion of his future patrimony was handed
over to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be no further trouble to you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
mayn&#8217;t ever hear of me again. This is the end of me as far
as you are concerned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That night, with a valise in his hand, he took his place
in the stage running towards the mountain regions of
North Carolina, and from that day forward the place knew
him no more. It was as he had known it would be: no one
was very sorry to be rid of him, and even Delia&#8217;s sadness
was at length toned down by the excitement of preparation
for and the festivities attendant upon her triumphant
union with the most dashing De Willoughby of the flock.
</p>
<p>When this event occurred, Tom&#8217;s wanderings had ended
temporarily in the farm-house referred to in the first chapter,
and his appearance in this remote and usually undisturbed
portion of his country had created some sensation.
The news of the arrival of a stranger had spread itself
abroad and aroused a slow-growing excitement.
</p>
<p>They were a kindly, simple people who surrounded him&mdash;hospitable,
ignorant, and curious beyond measure concerning
the ways of the outside world of which they knew
so little.
</p>
<p>In the course of time, as the first keenness of his misery
wore away, Tom began to discover the advantages of the
change he had made. He no longer need contrast himself
unfavourably with his neighbours. He knew more than
they, and they found nothing in him to condemn or jeer at.
To them he was a mine of worldly knowledge. He amused
them and won their hearts. His natural indolence and
lack of active ambition helped the healing of his wounds,
perhaps; and then he began to appreciate the humourous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
side of his position and his old tendency to ponderous joking
came back, and assisted him to win a greater popularity
than any mere practical quality could have done.
</p>
<p>The novelty of his <i>rôle</i> was its chief attraction. He began
to enjoy and give himself up to it, and make the most
of his few gifts. Life was no longer without zest. His
natural indolence increased with the size of his great body
as the years passed, and his slow whimsical humour became
his strongest characteristic. He felt it a fine point in the
sarcasm of his destiny that he should at last have become
a hero and be regarded with admiration for his conversational
abilities, but he bore his honours discreetly, and
found both moral and physical comfort in them.
</p>
<p>He insensibly adopted the habits of his neighbours; he
dressed with their primitive regard for ease; he dropped
now and then into their slurring speech, and adopted one
by one their arcadian customs.
</p>
<p>Whether the change was the better or the worse for him
might easily be a matter of opinion, and depend entirely on
the standpoint from which it was viewed. At least he
lived harmlessly and had no enemy.
</p>
<p>And so existence stood with him when the second great
change in his life took place.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p>Scarcely a month before the events described in the
opening chapter took place, the stranger and a young
woman, who was his companion, had appeared in the community.
There was little that seemed mysterious about
them at the outset. A long, uninhabited cabin, a score or
so of yards from the mountain road, had been roughly
patched up and taken possession of by them. There was
nothing unusual in the circumstance except that they had
appeared suddenly and entirely unheralded; but this in
itself would have awakened no special comment. The
mystery developed itself from their after reserve and seclusion.
They guarded themselves from all advances by
keeping out of sight when anyone approached their cabin.
The young woman was rarely, if ever, seen. The man
never called at the post-office for mail, and upon the few
occasions on which a stray human being crossed his path,
his manner was such as by no means encouraged the curious.
Mr. Stamps was the only individual who had seen
the woman face to face. There was an unmoved pertinacity
in the character of Mr. Stamps which stood him in good
stead upon all occasions. He was not easily abashed or
rebuffed, the more especially when he held in view some
practical object. Possibly he held some such object in
view when he rode up to the tumbled down gateway and
asked for the draught of water no woman of the region
could refuse without some reasonable excuse.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t airs they&#8217;re puttin&#8217; on, Cindy,&#8221; he said to the
partner of his joys and sorrows the evening after his ride
over the mountain. &#8220;Oh, no, &#8217;tain&#8217;t airs, it&#8217;s somethin&#8217;
more curi&#8217;s than that!&#8221; And he bent over the fire in a
comfortable lounging way, rubbing his hands a little, and
blinked at the back log thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>They were a friendly and sociable people, these mountaineers,
all the more so because the opportunities for meeting
sociably were limited. The men had their work and
the women their always large families to attend to, and
with a mile or so of rough road between themselves and
their neighbours, there was not much chance for enjoyable
gossip. When good fortune threw them together
they usually made the best of their time. Consequently,
the mystery of two human beings, who had shut themselves
off with apparent intent from all intercourse with their
kind, was a difficulty not readily disposed of. It was, perhaps,
little to be wondered at that Mr. Stamps thought it
over and gathered carefully together all the points presenting
themselves to his notice. The subject had been frequently
discussed at the Cross-roads post-office. The disposition
to seclusion was generally spoken of as &#8220;curi&#8217;sness,&#8221;
and various theories had been advanced with a view
to explaining the &#8220;curi&#8217;sness&#8221; in question. &#8220;Airs&#8221; had
been suggested as a solution of the difficulty, but as time
progressed, the theory of &#8220;airs&#8221; had been abandoned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fur,&#8221; said Uncle Jake Wooten, who was a patriarch
and an authority, &#8220;when a man&#8217;s a-gwine to put on airs, he
kinder slicks up more. A man that&#8217;s airy, he ain&#8217;t a-gwine
to shut hisself up and not show out more. Like as not
he&#8217;d wear store-clothes an&#8217; hang round &#8216;n&#8217; kinder blow;
&#8216;n&#8217; this feller don&#8217;t do nary one. &#8216;N&#8217; as to the woman, Lord!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
I should think all you&#8217;unses knows how womenfolks does
that&#8217;s airy. Ef this yere one wus that way, she&#8217;d be a-dressin&#8217;
in starched calikers &#8216;n&#8217; sunbonnets &#8216;n&#8217; bress-pins,
&#8216;n&#8217; mebbe rings &#8216;n&#8217; congrist-gaiters. She&#8217;d be to the meetin&#8217;
every time there was meetin&#8217; a-showin&#8217; out &#8216;n&#8217; lettin&#8217;
on like she didn&#8217;t know the rest on &#8217;em wus seein&#8217;. It
don&#8217;t sound to reason that either on &#8217;em is airy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It had been suggested by a bold spirit capable of more
extended flights of the imagination than the rest, that they
were &#8220;Northerners&#8221; who for some unworthy object had
taken up their abode within the bound of civilisation; but
this idea was frowned down as being of a wild nature and
not to be encouraged.
</p>
<p>Finally the general interest in the subject had subsided
somewhat, though it was ready to revive at any new comment
or incident, which will explain the bodily awakening
of the sleepers on the post-office porch when Mr. Stamps
made his announcement of the approach of &#8220;thet thar
feller.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Up to the moment when the impulse seized him which
led him to take his place behind the counter as the stranger
entered the store, Tom De Willoughby had taken little or
no part in numerous discussions held around him. He had
listened with impartiality to all sides of the question, his
portion of the entertainment being to make comments of
an inspiriting nature which should express in a marked
manner his sarcastic approval of any special weakness in
a line of argument.
</p>
<p>Among the many agreeable things said of him in his
past, it had never been said that he was curious; he was
too indolent to be curious, and it may be simply asserted
that he had felt little curiosity concerning the popular
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
mystery. But when he found himself face to face with his
customer, a new feeling suddenly took possession of him.
The change came when, for one instant, the man, as if in
momentary forgetfulness, looked up and met his eyes in
speaking. Each moved involuntarily, and Tom turned
aside, ostensibly, to pick up a sheet of wrapping paper.
The only words exchanged were those relating to the courtesies
and the brief remarks heard by the loungers outside.
After this the stranger rode away and Tom lounged back
to his chair. He made no reply to Stamps&#8217;s explanatory
aside, and no comment upon the remarks of the company
whose curiosity had naturally received a new impetus which
spurred them on to gossip a little in the usual vague manner.
He gave himself up to speculation. The mere tone of
a man&#8217;s voice had set his mind to work. His past life had
given him experience in which those about him were lacking,
and at the instant he heard the stranger speak this
experience revealed to him as by a flash of light, a thing
which had never yet been even remotely guessed at.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A gentleman, by thunder!&#8221; he said to himself.
&#8220;That&#8217;s it! A gentleman!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He knew he could not be mistaken. Low and purposely
muffled as the voice had been, he recognised in it that
which marked it as the voice of a man trained to modulated
speech. And even this was not all, though it had led him
to look again, and more closely, at the face shadowed by
the broad hat. It was not a handsome face, but it was one
not likely to be readily forgotten. It was worn and haggard,
the features strongly aquiline, the eyes somewhat
sunken; it was the face of a man who had lived the life of
an ascetic and who, with a capacity for sharp suffering,
had suffered and was suffering still.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But a gentleman and not a Southerner,&#8221; Tom persisted
to himself. &#8220;A Yankee, as I&#8217;m a sinner; and what is a
Yankee doing hiding himself here for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was such a startling thing under the circumstances,
that he could not rid himself of the thought of it. It
haunted him through the rest of the day, and when night
came and the store being closed, he retired as usual to the
back part of the house, he was brooding over it still.
</p>
<p>He lived in a simple and primitive style. Three rooms
built on to the store were quite enough for him. One was
his sitting- and bedroom, another his dining-room and
kitchen, the third the private apartment of his household
goddess, a stout old mulatto woman who kept his house in
order and prepared his meals.
</p>
<p>When he opened the door to-night the little boarded
rooms were illuminated with two tallow candles and made
fragrant with the odour of fried chicken and hoe-cakes,
to which Aunt Mornin was devoting all her energies, and
for the first time perhaps in his life, he failed to greet
these attractions with his usual air of good cheer.
</p>
<p>He threw his hat into a chair, and, stretching himself out
upon the bedstead, lay there, his hands clasped above his
head and his eyes fixed upon the glow of the fire in the adjoining
room, where Aunt Mornin was at work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A gentleman!&#8221; he said, half aloud. &#8220;That&#8217;s it, by
Jupiter, a gentleman!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He remembered it afterwards as a curious coincidence
that he should have busied his mind so actively with his
subject in a manner so unusual with him.
</p>
<p>His imagination not being sufficiently vivid to help him
out of his difficulty to his own satisfaction, he laboured
with it patiently, recurring to it again and again, and turning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
it over until it assumed a greater interest than at first.
He only relinquished it with an effort when, going to bed
later than usual, he made up his mind to compose himself
to sleep.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he said, turning on his side and addressing
some unseen presence representing the vexed question.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t keep a man awake: settle it yourself.&#8221; And finally
sank into unconsciousness in the midst of his mental struggle.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>About the middle of the night he awakened. He felt
that something had startled him from his sleep, but could
not tell what it was. A few seconds he lay without moving,
listening, and as he listened there came to his ear the
sound of a horse&#8217;s feet, treading the earth restlessly outside
the door, the animal itself breathing heavily as if it had
been ridden hard; and almost as soon as he aroused to
recognition of this fact, there came a sharp tap on the door
and a man&#8217;s voice crying &#8220;Hallo!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He knew the voice at once, and unexpected as the summons
was, felt he was not altogether unprepared for it,
though he could not have offered even the weakest explanation
for the feeling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in trouble,&#8221; he said, as he sat up quickly in bed.
&#8220;Something&#8217;s gone wrong.&#8221; He rose and in a few seconds
opened the door.
</p>
<p>He had guessed rightly; it was the stranger. The moonlight
fell full upon the side of the house and the road, and
the panting horse stood revealed in a bright light which
gave the man&#8217;s face a ghostly look added to his natural
pallor. As he leaned forward, Tom saw that he was as
much exhausted as was the animal he had ridden.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want to find a doctor, or a woman who can give help
to another,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t a doctor within fifteen miles from here,&#8221;
began Tom. He stopped short. What he saw in the man&#8217;s
face checked him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is it your wife?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man made a sharp gesture of despair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dying, I think,&#8221; he said, hoarsely, &#8220;and there&#8217;s
not a human being near her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; cried Tom, &#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; The sweat
started out on his forehead. He remembered what Stamps
had said of her youth and her pale face, and he thought
of Delia Vanuxem, and from this thought sprang a sudden
recollection of the deserted medical career in which he had
been regarded as so ignominious a failure. He had never
mentioned it since he had cut himself off from the old life,
and the women for whose children he had prescribed with
some success now and then had considered the ends
achieved only the natural results of his multitudinous gifts.
But the thought of the desolate young creature lying there
alone struck deep. He listened one moment, then made his
resolve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to the stable,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and throw a saddle over
the horse you will find there. I know something of such
matters myself, and I shall be better than nothing, with
a woman&#8217;s help. I have a woman here who will follow
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went into the back room and awakened Aunt Mornin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and saddle the mule and follow me
as soon as you can to the cabin in Blair&#8217;s Hollow. The
wife of a man who lives there needs a woman with her.
Come quickly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>When he returned to the door his horse stood there saddled,
the stranger sitting on his own and holding the
bridle.
</p>
<p>Tom mounted in silence, but once finally seated, he
turned to his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now strike out,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>There were four miles of road before them, but they
scarcely slackened rein until they were within sight of the
Hollow, and the few words they exchanged were the barest
questions and answers.
</p>
<p>The cabin was built away from the road on the side of
the hill, and leaving their horses tethered at the foot of the
slope, they climbed it together.
</p>
<p>When they reached the door, the stranger stopped and
turned to Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no sound inside,&#8221; he faltered; &#8220;I dare not
go in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom strode by him and pushed the door open.
</p>
<p>In one corner of the room was a roughly made bedstead,
and upon it lay a girl, her deathly pale face turned sideways
upon the pillow. It was as if she lay prostrated by
some wave of agony which had just passed over her; her
breath was faint and rapid, and great drops of sweat stood
out upon her young drawn face.
</p>
<p>Tom drew a chair forward and sat down beside her. He
lifted one of her hands, touching it gently, but save for a
slight quiver of the eyelids she did not stir. A sense of awe
fell upon him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Death,&#8221; he said to himself. He had experience
enough to teach him that. He turned to the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better go out of the room; I will do my best.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>In a little over an hour Aunt Mornin dismounted from
her mule and tethered it to a sapling at the side of the
road below. She looked up at the light gleaming faintly
through the pines on the hillside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cum &#8217;s fas&#8217; &#8217;s I could,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I reckon I&#8217;d
orter been here afore. De Lord knows dis is a curi&#8217;s &#8217;casion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she crossed the threshold of the cabin, her master
pointed to a small faintly moving bundle lying at the foot
of the bed over which he was bending.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it into the other room and tell the man to come
here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no time to lose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He still held the weak hand; but the girl&#8217;s eyes were no
longer closed; they were open and fixed on his face. The
great fellow was trembling like a leaf. The past hour had
been almost more than he could bear. He was entirely
unstrung.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t cut out for this kind of thing,&#8221; he had groaned
more than once, and for the first time in his life thanked
Fate for making him a failure.
</p>
<p>As he looked down at his patient, a mist rose before his
eyes, blurring his sight, and he hurriedly brushed it
away.
</p>
<p>She was perhaps nineteen years old, and had the very
young look a simple trusting nature and innocent untried
life bring. She was small, fragile, and fair, with the pure
fairness born of a cold climate. Her large blue-gray eyes
had in them the piteous appeal sometimes to be seen in the
eyes of a timid child.
</p>
<p>Tom had laid his big hand on her forehead and stroked
it, scarcely knowing what he did.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened,&#8221; he said, with a tremor in his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
voice. &#8220;Close your eyes and try to be quiet for a few
moments, and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stooped to bend his ear to her lips which were moving
faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come directly,&#8221; he answered, though he did not
hear her; &#8220;&mdash;directly. It&#8217;s all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then he stroked her hair again because he knew
not what else to do, seeing, as he did, that the end was so
very near, and that no earthly power, however far beyond
his own poor efforts, could ward it off.
</p>
<p>Just at that moment the door opened and the man came
in.
</p>
<p>That he too read the awful truth at his first glance, Tom
saw. All attempts at disguise had dropped away. His
thin, scholarly face was as colourless as the fairer one on
the pillow, his brows were knit into rigid lines and his lips
were working. He approached the bed, and for a few moments
stood looking down as if trying to give himself time
to gain self-control. Tom saw the girl&#8217;s soft eyes fixed in
anguished entreaty; there was a struggle, and from the
slowly moving lips came a few faint and broken words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Death!&mdash;They&mdash;never know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man flung himself upon his knees and burst into an
agony of such weeping that, seeing it, Tom turned away
shuddering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they will never know, they who loved
you&mdash;who loved you&mdash;will never know! God forgive me if
I have done wrong. I have been false that they might be
spared. God forgive me for the sin!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The poor child shivered; she had become still paler, and
the breath came in sharp little puffs through her nostrils.
</p>
<p>&#8220;God&mdash;God!&mdash;God!&#8221; she panted. But the man did not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
seem to hear her. He was praying aloud, a struggling, disjointed
prayer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O God of sinners,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;Thou who forgivest,
Thou who hast died, forgive&mdash;forgive in this hour of
death!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom heard no more. He could only listen to the soft,
panting breath sinking lower and lower.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the piteous eyes turned towards him&mdash;the
stranger&mdash;as if in great dread: perhaps they saw in the
mere human pity of his face what met some sharp last
need.
</p>
<p>He went to his old place as if in answer to the look, and
took the poor little hand once more, closing the warmth
of his own over its coldness. He was weeping like a child.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; he said; &#8220;&mdash;not afraid. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s all
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And almost as he said it, with her eyes still fixed upon
his own, and with her hand in his, she gave a low sob&mdash;and
died.
</p>
<p>Tom touched the kneeling man upon the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need of that now,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it&#8217;s over.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p>When a few minutes later he went into the back room,
he found Aunt Mornin sitting before the big fireplace in
which burned a few logs of wood. The light the snapping
sticks gave fell full upon her black face, and upon the small
bundle upon her spacious knee.
</p>
<p>As he entered she turned sharply towards him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t nobody keer nothin&#8217; for this yere?&#8221; she said,
&#8220;ain&#8217;t nobody comin&#8217; nigh? Whar&#8217;s he? Don&#8217;t he take
no int&#8217;rus&#8217; in the pore little lonesome child? I &#8217;spect yo&#8217;ll
haf to take it ye&#8217;self, Mars&#8217; De Willerby, while I goes in
dar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom stopped short, stricken with a pang of remorse. He
looked down at the small face helplessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll have to go in there; you&#8217;re
needed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman looked at him in startled questioning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mars De Willerby,&#8221; she said, &#8220;does dat ar mean she&#8217;s
cl&#8217;ar gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Tom. &#8220;She&#8217;s gone, Mornin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With the emotional readiness of her race, the comfortable
creature burst into weeping, clasping the child to her
broad bosom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pore chile!&#8221; she said, &#8220;an&#8217; poor chile lef behin&#8217;! De
Lord help &#8217;em bofe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With manifest fear Tom stooped and took the little red
flannel bundle from her arms.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind crying,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Go into the room and
do what&#8217;s to be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When left alone with his charge, he sat down and held
it balanced carefully in his hands, his elbows resting on
his knees. He was used to carrying his customers&#8217; children,
a great part of his popularity being based upon his jovial
fondness for them. But he had never held so small a
creature as this in his arms before. He regarded it with
a respectful timidity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t thought of,&#8221; he said, reflectively. &#8220;Even
she&mdash;poor thing, poor thing&mdash;&#8221; he ended, hurriedly, &#8220;there
was no time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was still holding his small burden with awkward
kindliness when the door opened and the man he had left
in the room beyond came in. He approached the hearth
and stood for a few seconds staring at the fire in a stupefied,
abstracted way. He did not seem to see the child. At last
he spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where shall I lay her?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Where is the
nearest churchyard?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifteen miles away,&#8221; Tom answered. &#8220;Most of the
people like to have their dead near them and lay them on
the hillsides.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man turned to him with a touch of horror in his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In unconsecrated ground?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t trouble them,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;They sleep well
enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man turned to the fire again&mdash;he had not looked at
the child yet&mdash;and made a despairing gesture with his
hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That she&mdash;&#8221; he said, &#8220;that she should lie so far from
them, and in unconsecrated ground!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is the place I told you of,&#8221; said Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot go there,&#8221; with the gesture again. &#8220;There
is no time. I must go away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made no pretence at concealing that he had a secret
to hide. He seemed to have given up the effort.
</p>
<p>Tom looked up at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with this?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Then for the first time he seemed to become conscious of
the child&#8217;s presence. He turned and gave it a startled sidelong
glance, as if he had suddenly been struck with a new
fear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;do not know,&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;I&mdash;no! I do not
know. What have I been doing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sank into a chair and buried his face in his trembling
hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s curse is upon it,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;There is no place
for it on earth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom rose with a sudden movement and began to pace the
floor with his charge in his arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little chap to lay a curse on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And
helpless enough, by Gad!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked down at the diminutive face, and as he did
so, a wild thought flashed through his mind. It had the
suddenness and force of a revelation. His big body
trembled with some feeling it would have gone hard with
him to express, and his heart warmed within him as he felt
the light weight lying against it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No place for it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;By God, there is! There
is a place <i>here</i>&mdash;and a man to stand by and see fair-play!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give her to me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;give her to me, and if there
is no place for her, I&#8217;ll find one.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; faltered the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean what I say,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take her and
stand by her as long as there is breath in me; and if the
day should ever come in spite of me when wrong befalls
her, as it befell her mother, some man shall die, so help me
God!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The warm Southern blood which gave to his brothers&#8217;
love-songs the grace of passion, and which made them renowned
for their picturesque eloquence of speech, fired him
to greater fluency than was usual with him, when he thought
of the helplessness of the tiny being he held.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never betrayed a woman yet, or did one a wrong,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;I&#8217;m not one of the lucky fellows who win
their hearts,&#8221; with a great gulp in his throat. &#8220;Perhaps
if there&#8217;s no one to come between us, she may&mdash;may be
fond of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man gave him a long look, as if he was asking himself
a question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;she will be fond of you. You
will be worthy of it. There is no one to lay claim to
her. Her mother lies dead among strangers, and her
father&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a few moments he seemed to be falling into a reverie,
but suddenly a tremour seized him and he struck one
clenched hand against the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If a man vowed to the service of God may make an
oath,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I swear that if the day ever dawns when
we stand face to face, knowing each other, I will not spare
him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The child stirred in Tom&#8217;s arms and uttered its first
sharp little cry, and as if in answer to the summons, Aunt
Mornin opened the door.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all done,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Gib me de chile, Mars De
Willerby, and go in an&#8217; look at her.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When he entered the little square living room, Tom
paused at the foot of the bed. All was straight and neat
and cold. Among the few articles in the one small trunk,
the woman had found a simple white dress and had put it
on the dead girl. It was such a garment as almost every
girl counts among her possessions. Tom remembered that
his sisters had often worn such things.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She looks very pretty,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I dare say her
mother made it and she wore it at home. O Lord! O
Lord!&#8221; And with this helpless exclamation, half sigh,
half groan, he turned away and walked out of the front
door into the open air.
</p>
<p>It was early morning by this time, and he passed into
the dew and sunlight not knowing where he was going;
but once outside, the sight of his horse tethered to a tree
at the roadside brought to his mind the necessity of the
occasion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ride in and see Steven,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s got to be
done, and it&#8217;s no work for <i>him</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he reached the Cross-roads there were already two
or three early arrivals lounging on the store-porch and
wondering why the doors were not opened.
</p>
<p>The first man who saw him, opened upon him the usual
course of elephantine witticisms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look a yere, Tom,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;this ain&#8217;t a-gwine to
do. You a-gittin&#8217; up &#8217;fore daybreak like the rest of us
folks and ridin&#8217; off Goddlemighty knows whar. It ain&#8217;t
a-gwine to do now. Whar air ye from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But as he rode up and dismounted at the porch, each
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
saw that something unusual had happened. He tied his
horse and came up the steps in silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, when he stood among them, &#8220;I want
Steven. I&#8217;ve been out to the Hollow, and there&#8217;s a job for
him there. The&mdash;the woman&#8217;s dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; they echoed, drawing nearer to him in their
excitement. &#8220;When, Tom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night. Mornin&#8217;s out there. There&#8217;s a child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thunder &#8216;n&#8217; molasses!&#8221; ejaculated the only family man
of the group, reflectively. &#8220;Thunder &#8216;n&#8217; molasses!&#8221; And
then he began to edge away, still with a reflective air, towards
his mule.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;there&#8217;d ought to be some women
folks around. I&#8217;m gwine for Minty, and she&#8217;ll start the rest
on &#8217;em. Women folks is what&#8217;s needed. They kin kinder
organize things whar thar&#8217;s trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;perhaps you&#8217;re right; but don&#8217;t
send too many of &#8217;em, and let your wife tell &#8217;em to talk
as little as possible and leave the man alone. He&#8217;s got
enough to stand up under.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before the day was over there were women enough in the
hillside cabin. Half a dozen faded black calico riding-skirts
hung over the saddles of half a dozen horses tethered in the
wood round the house, while inside half a dozen excellent
souls disposed themselves in sympathetic couples about the
two rooms.
</p>
<p>Three sat in the front room, their sunbonnets drawn well
down over their faces in the true mourner&#8217;s spirit, one at
the head of the bed slowly moving a fan to and fro over
the handkerchief-covered face upon the pillow. A dead
silence pervaded the place, except when it was broken by
occasional brief remarks made in a whisper.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She was a mighty purty-lookin&#8217; young critter,&#8221; they
said. &#8220;A sight younger-lookin&#8217; than her man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the child?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gal? That&#8217;s a pity. Gals ain&#8217;t much chance of bein&#8217;
raised right whar they&#8217;re left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hain&#8217;t they any folks, neither on &#8217;em?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody don&#8217;t know. Nobody hain&#8217;t heerd nothin&#8217;
about &#8217;em. They wus kinder curi&#8217;s about keepin&#8217; to themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If either on &#8217;em had any folks&mdash;even if they wus only
sort o&#8217; kin&mdash;they might take the chile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe they will. Seems to reason they must have some
kin&mdash;even if they ain&#8217;t nigh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the silence reigned again and the woman at the
bed&#8217;s head gave her undivided attention to the slow, regular
motion of her palm-leaf fan.
</p>
<p>In the room beyond a small fire burned in spite of the
warmth of the day, and divers small tin cups and pipkins
simmered before and upon the cinders of it, Aunt Mornin
varying her other duties by moving them a shade nearer to
the heat or farther from it, and stirring and tasting at intervals.
</p>
<p>Upon a low rocking-chair before the hearth sat the wife
of the family man before referred to. She was a tall, angular
creature, the mother of fifteen, comprising in their number
three sets of twins. She held her snuff-stick between
her teeth and the child on her lap, with an easy professional
air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t never had to raise none o&#8217; mine by hand since
Martin Luther,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been mighty glad
on it, for he was a sight o&#8217; trouble. Kinder colicky and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
weakly. Never done no good till we got him off the bottle.
He&#8217;d one cow&#8217;s milk, too, all the time. I was powerful
partickerler &#8217;bout that. I&#8217;d never have raised him if I
hadn&#8217;t bin. &#8216;N&#8217; to this day Martin Luther hain&#8217;t what
&#8217;Poleon and Orlando is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dis yere chile ain&#8217;t gwine to be no trouble to nobody,&#8221;
put in Aunt Mornin. &#8220;She&#8217;s a powerful good chile to begin
with, &#8216;n&#8217; she&#8217;s a chile that&#8217;s gwine to thrive. She hain&#8217;t
done no cryin&#8217; uv no consequence yit, &#8216;n&#8217; whar a chile starts
out dat dar way it speaks well for her. If Mornin had de
raisin&#8217; o&#8217; dat chile, dar wouldn&#8217;t be no trouble &#8217;t all. Bile
der milk well &#8216;n&#8217; d&#8217;lute down right, &#8216;n&#8217; a chile like dat ain&#8217;t
gwine to have no colick. My young Mistis Mars D&#8217;Willerby
bought me from, I&#8217;ve raised three o&#8217; hern, an&#8217; I&#8217;m used to
bilin&#8217; it right and d&#8217;lutin&#8217; it down right. Dar&#8217;s a heap in
de d&#8217;lutin&#8217;. Dis yere bottle&#8217;s ready now, Mis&#8217; Doty, ef ye
want it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the very bottle I raised Martin Luther on,&#8221; said
Mrs. Doty. &#8220;It brings back ole times to see it. She takes
it purty well, don&#8217;t she? Massy sakes! How f&#8217;erce she looks
for sich a little thing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Later in the day there arose the question of how she
should be disposed of for the night, and it was in the midst
of this discussion that Tom De Willoughby entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar ain&#8217;t but one room; I s&#8217;pose he&#8217;ll sleep in that,&#8221;
said Mrs. Doty, &#8220;&#8216;n&#8217; the Lord knows he don&#8217;t look the kind
o&#8217; critter to know what to do with a chile. We hain&#8217;t none
o&#8217; us seen him since this mornin&#8217;. I guess he&#8217;s kinder wanderin&#8217;
round. Does any of you know whar he is? We might
ax what he &#8217;lows to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom bent down over the child as it lay in the woman&#8217;s
lap. No one could see his face.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know what he&#8217;s going to do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s going
away to-morrow after the funeral.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;N&#8217; take the child?&#8221; in a chorus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tom, professing to be deeply interested in
the unclosing of the small red fist. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take the
child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were four sharp exclamations, and for a second or
so all four women gazed at him with open mouths. It was
Mrs. Doty who first recovered herself sufficiently to speak.
She gave him a lively dig with her elbow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Tom D&#8217;Willerby,&#8221; she said, &#8220;none of your foolin&#8217;.
This yere ain&#8217;t no time for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mars D&#8217;Willerby,&#8221; said Aunt Mornin, &#8220;dis chile&#8217;s
mother&#8217;s a-lyin&#8217; dead in the nex&#8217; room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom stooped a trifle lower. He put out both his hands
and took the baby in them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not foolin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, rather uncertainly. &#8220;I&#8217;m in
earnest, ladies. The mother is dead and the man&#8217;s going
away. There&#8217;s nobody else to claim her, he tells me, and
so I&#8217;ll claim her. There&#8217;s enough of me to take care of
her, and I mean to do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was so extraordinary a sensation, that for a few moments
there was another silence, broken as before by Mrs. Doty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Waal,&#8221; she remarked, removing her snuff-stick and expectorating
into the fire. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ve allus been kinder fond
o&#8217; chillun, Tom, and mebbe she ain&#8217;t as colicky by natur&#8217;
as Martin Luther was, but I mus&#8217; say it&#8217;s the curi&#8217;sest thing
I ever heern&mdash;him a-gwine away an&#8217; givin&#8217; her cl&#8217;ar up as
ef he hadn&#8217;t no sort o&#8217; nat&#8217;ral feelin&#8217;s&mdash;I do say it&#8217;s curi&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a queer fellow,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;a queer fellow!
There&#8217;s no denying that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That this was true was proven by his conduct during the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
time in which it was liable to public comment. Until night
he was not seen, and then he came in at a late hour and,
walking in silence through the roomful of watchers, shut
himself up in an inner chamber and remained there alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s takin&#8217; it mighty hard,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Seems like
it&#8217;s kinder onsettled his mind. He hain&#8217;t never looked at
the child once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not appear at all the next day until all was ready
and Tom De Willoughby went to him.
</p>
<p>He found him lying on the bed, his haggard face turned
towards the window. He did not move until Tom touched
him on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to see her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>He started and shuddered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, so soon?&#8221; he said. &#8220;So soon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Tom answered. &#8220;Get up and come with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He obeyed, following him mechanically, but when they
reached the door, Tom stopped him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told them a story that suits well enough,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve told them that you&#8217;re poor and have no friends, and
can&#8217;t care for the child, and I&#8217;ve a fancy for keeping it.
The mother is to lie out here on the hillside until you can
afford to find a better place for her&mdash;perhaps at your own
home. I&#8217;ve told the tale my own way. I&#8217;m not much of
a hand at that kind of thing, but it&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;ve asked you
no questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the man, drearily. &#8220;You&#8217;ve asked me no
questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then they went together into the other room. There were
twenty or thirty people in it, or standing about the door.
It was like all mountain funerals, but for an air of desolateness
even deeper than usual. The slender pine coffin was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
supported upon two chairs in the middle of the room, and
the women stood or sat about, the more easily moved weeping
a little under the shadow of their calico sunbonnets.
The men leaned against the door-posts, or sat on the wooden
steps, bare-headed, silent, and rather restless.
</p>
<p>When Tom led his charge into the apartment, there was
a slight stir and moving back of chairs to make way for him.
He made his way straight to the coffin. When he reached
it and looked down, he started. Perhaps the sight of the
white dress with its simple girlish frills and homelike prettiness
brought back to him some memory of happier days
when he had seen it worn before.
</p>
<p>The pure, childlike face had settled into utter calm, and
across the breast and in the hands were long, slender branches
of the thickly flowering wild white clematis. Half an hour
before Tom had gone into the woods and returned with these
branches, which he gave to one of the younger women.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put them on her,&#8221; he said, awkwardly; &#8220;there ought
to be some flowers about her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a few moments there reigned in the room a dead silence.
All eyes were fixed upon the man who stood at the
coffin side. He simply looked down at the fair dead face.
He bestowed no caresses upon it, and shed no tears, though
now and then there was to be seen a muscular contraction
of his throat.
</p>
<p>At length he turned towards those surrounding him and
raised his hand, speaking in a low voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us pray.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the manner of a man trained to rigid religious observances,
and when the words were uttered, something like
an electric shock passed through his hearers. The circuit-riders
who stopped once or twice a month at the log churches
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
on the roadside were seldom within reach on such an occasion
as this, and at such times it was their custom to depend on
any good soul who was considered to have the gift of prayer.
Perhaps some of them had been wondering who would speak
the last words now, as there was no such person on the spot;
but the trained manner and gesture, even while it startled
them by its unexpectedness, set their minds at rest.
</p>
<p>They settled themselves in the conventional posture, the
women retiring into their bonnets, the men hanging their
heads, and the prayer began.
</p>
<p>It was a strange appeal&mdash;one which only one man among
them could grasp the meaning of, though all regarded its
outpouring words with wonder and admiration. It was an
outcry full of passion, dread, and anguish which was like
despair. It was a prayer for mercy&mdash;mercy for those who
suffered, for the innocent who might suffer&mdash;for loving
hearts too tender to bear the bitter blows of life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The loving hearts, O God!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;the loving hearts
who wait&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>More than one woman looked up from under her bonnet;
his body began to tremble&mdash;he staggered and fell into a
chair, hiding his face, shaking from head to foot in an
agony of weeping. Tom made his way to him and bent
over him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; he said, his great voice broken. &#8220;Come
with me into the air, it will quiet you, and we can wait until&mdash;until
they come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He put his arm under his and supported him out of the
house.
</p>
<p>Two or three women began to rock themselves to and fro
and weep aloud hysterically. It was only the stronger ones
who could control themselves. He was standing at Tom&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
side then; when they came out a short time afterwards,
walking slowly and carrying the light burden, which they
lowered into its resting-place beneath the pines.
</p>
<p>He was quite calm again, and made no sound or movement
until all was over. Then he spoke to Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell them,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I thank them. I can do
no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He walked back to the desolate house, and in a little while
the people went their ways, each of them looking back a
little wistfully at the cabin as he or she rode out of sight.
</p>
<p>When the last one was lost to view, Tom, who had loitered
about, went into the cabin.
</p>
<p>The man was sitting in the empty room, his gaze fixed
upon the two chairs left standing in the middle of it a few
paces from each other.
</p>
<p>Tom moved them away and then approached him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The child has been taken to my house,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t want to see it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything else I can do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nothing else,&#8221; monotonously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom glanced around him at the desolation of the poor,
bare little place, at the empty bed, and the small trunk at
the foot of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not going to stay here alone, man?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he was answered. &#8220;I have something to do; I
must be alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom hesitated a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, at length, &#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ve done, then.
Good-bye.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; he was answered. &#8220;The Lord&mdash;the Lord
will reward you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then Tom crossed the room slowly and reluctantly,
passed out, and closed the door after him.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When he opened his own door, he struck his foot against
something and stumbled over it. It was a primitive wooden
cradle&mdash;somewhat like a box on rockers&mdash;a quilt of patchwork
covered it, and upon the small pillow rested the round
black head of his new possession. He stopped short to
regard it. Aunt Mornin had left it there while she occupied
herself with preparing supper in the kitchen. It really
looked quite comfortable. Gradually a smile established itself
upon Tom&#8217;s countenance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By thunder!&#8221; he said, &#8220;here you are, youngster, ain&#8217;t
you? You&#8217;ve come to stay&mdash;that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve come for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And, being answered by a slight stirring of the patchwork
quilt, he put his foot out with much cautiousness, touched
the rocker, and, finding to his great astonishment that he
had accomplished this much safely, he drew up a chair, and,
sitting down, devoted himself with laudable enthusiasm to
engineering the small ark with a serious and domestic air.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p>In two days&#8217; time the whole country had heard the news.
The mystery of Blair&#8217;s Hollow was revived and became a
greater mystery than ever. The woman was dead, the man
had disappeared. The cabin stood deserted, save for the
few household goods which had been left just as they were
on the day of the funeral. Not an article had been moved,
though the woman to whom Tom De Willoughby, as the
person most concerned, handed over the discarded property,
did not find the little trunk, and noticed that articles had
been burned in the fireplace in the front room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar wus a big pile o&#8217; ashes on the ha&#8217;th,&#8221; she said to
her friends, &#8220;sorter like as if he&#8217;d been burnin&#8217; a heap a
little things o&#8217; one sort or &#8217;nother. It kinder give me cold
chills, it looked so lonesome when I shut the door arter the
truck was gone. I left the ashes a-lyin&#8217; thar. I kinder had
a curi&#8217;s feelin&#8217; about touchin&#8217; on &#8217;em. Nothing wouldn&#8217;t
hire me to live thar. D&#8217;Willerby said he reckoned I could
hev moved right in ef I wanted to, but, Lawsy! I wouldn&#8217;t
have done it fer nothin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But that which roused the greatest excitement in the community
was Tom De Willoughby&#8217;s course.
</p>
<p>At first Mrs. Doty&#8217;s story of Big Tom&#8217;s adoption of the
child was scarcely accepted as being a possibility. The first
man who heard it received it with a grin of disbelief. This
individual was naturally Mr. Doty himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Minty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t ye let him fool ye. Don&#8217;t ye
know Tom D&#8217;Willerby by this time? Ye&#8217;d orter. It&#8217;s jest
some o&#8217; his gas. Don&#8217;t ye s&#8217;pose he hain&#8217;t got no more sense?
What&#8217;d he do with it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye can believe it or not,&#8221; replied Mrs. Doty, sharply,
&#8220;but he&#8217;s gwine to raise that young&#8217;n, as shore as your
name&#8217;s Job. Mornin&#8217;s got her this minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Doty indulged in a subdued chuckle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice-lookin&#8217; feller he is to raise a infant babe!&#8221; he
remarked. &#8220;Lord a massy! if thet thar ain&#8217;t jest like one
o&#8217; his doggoned tales! He is the derndest critter,&#8221; with
reflective delight, &#8220;the derndest! Thar ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; in
Hamlin to come up to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the next day even Mr. Doty was convinced. After
his customary visit to the Cross-roads, he returned to his
family wearing a bewildered expression. It became a sheepish
expression when his wife confronted him on the doorstep.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, Job Doty,&#8221; she remarked, &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve found
out by this time whether I was right or wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; answered Mr. Doty, throwing his saddle down
on the porch, &#8220;I reckon I hev. She&#8217;s thar shore enough,
&#8216;n&#8217; it seems like he&#8217;s gwine to keep her; but I wouldn&#8217;t
hev believed it ef I hadn&#8217;t seen it, doggoned ef I would!
But, Lord, it&#8217;s like him, arter all.&#8221; And he brightened up
and chuckled again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he don&#8217;t scarcely know what he&#8217;s tuk in hand,&#8221;
said Mrs. Doty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Him!&#8221; answered Mr. Doty. &#8220;Tom! Lord! &#8217;tain&#8217;t a-gwine
to trouble Tom. He&#8217;ll get along, Tom will. Tom&#8217;d
jus&#8217; as lief as she wus twins as not, mebbe liefer. It&#8217;d be
a bigger thing for him to engineer &#8216;n&#8217; gas about ef she wus.
Ef you&#8217;d seen him bring her into the store to the boys &#8216;n&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
brag on her &#8216;n&#8217; spread hisself, I reckon ye wouldn&#8217;t hev
minded &#8217;bout Tom. Why, he&#8217;s set on her, Minty, a&#8217;reddy,
as set as he kin be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Cross-roads post-office had indeed been the scene of
a sort of informal <i>levée</i> held by the newcomer, who had been
thus presented to her fellow-citizens. One man after another
had dropped in to hear the truth of the story related,
and each one had been dumfounded at the outset by Tom&#8217;s
simple statement of fact.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m going to keep her, boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She&#8217;s in
the back part of the house now. According to my calculations,
she&#8217;s drunk about three quarts of milk since morning,
and seems to stand it pretty well, so I suppose she&#8217;s all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were a great many jokes made at first, and a general
spirit of hilariousness reigned, but it was observed by one
of the keener witted ones that, despite his jocular tone, there
was an underlying seriousness in Tom&#8217;s air which might
argue that he felt the weight of his responsibility. When
the women began to come in, as they did later in the day,
he received them with much cordiality, rising from his chair
to shake hands with each matron as she appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in to see her, have you?&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s right.
She&#8217;s in the back room. Walk right in. Mis&#8217; Simpson and
Mis&#8217; Lyle, I&#8217;d like some of you ladies to have a look at her.
I&#8217;ll go with you myself and hear what you have to say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made the journey each time with a slight air of anxiety,
leading the way to the wooden cradle, and standing over
it like a Herculean guardian angel, listening attentively to
all the comments made and all the advice given.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She seems to be getting on pretty well, doesn&#8217;t she?&#8221;
he enquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lor&#8217;, yes!&#8221; said one matron; &#8220;jest keep her kivered up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
&#8216;n&#8217; don&#8217;t let no air strike her, &#8216;n&#8217; ye won&#8217;t hev no trouble
with her, I reckon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No air?&#8221; enquired Tom, in some trepidation; &#8220;none
at all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, thet&#8217;s my way,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Some folks does
diff&#8217;rent, but I didn&#8217;t never expose &#8217;em none till they was
more&#8217;n amonth old. New-born babies is tender things!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Good Lord, yes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>His visitor started at him perplexedly for a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My man allus used to say they kinder
skeered him &#8217;long at the first&mdash;he kinder felt as if they&#8217;d
mebbe come apart, or sumthin&#8217;. They allus sorter &#8217;minded
me o&#8217; young mice. Wal, you jest tell Mornin to giv&#8217; her
es much milk as she calls fer, an&#8217; don&#8217;t let it bile too long,
&#8216;n&#8217; she&#8217;ll come on fine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next visitor that entered uttered an exclamation of
dismay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re gwine ter kill her!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Thar ain&#8217;t a
breath o&#8217; air in the room, &#8216;n&#8217; thar ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; a new-born
baby wants more &#8217;n plenty o&#8217; air. They&#8217;re tender critters,
&#8216;n&#8217; they cayn&#8217;t stand to be smothered up. Ye&#8217;ll hev her in
spasms afore the day&#8217;s over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom flung the doors and windows open in great alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hot,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hot enough out of doors, but
Mis&#8217; Simpson told me to keep her shut up, and I thought
she&#8217;d had experience enough to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane Simpson!&#8221; with ill-concealed scorn. &#8220;She&#8217;d orter!
She&#8217;s had six to die in their second summer. I reckon
she told ye to give her half-b&#8217;iled milk as often as she wanted
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom reflected in manifest trepidation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She did tell me not to boil it too much, and to give it
to her when she called for it,&#8221; he said, slowly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, if ye don&#8217;t want ter kill her, take my advice an&#8217;
bile it a good half hour, &#8216;n&#8217; don&#8217;t give it to her oftener than
once in three hours. She&#8217;ll cry fur it, but ye needn&#8217;t mind.
Ye&#8217;ll get used ter it. I don&#8217;t believe in lettin&#8217; young uns
hev nuthin&#8217; out o&#8217; their reg&#8217;lar time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next caller found Tom somewhat discouraged. He
preceded her into the reception-chamber with less alacrity
than he had shown in his previous visits.
</p>
<p>She was a younger woman than the rest, and when she
reached the cradle&#8217;s side, she bent down and rearranged the
cover with a soft touch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gwine to be a purty little thing,&#8221; she said; &#8220;she&#8217;ll
be sorter dark-complected, but she&#8217;s gwine to hev purty hair
&#8216;n&#8217; eyes. Ye&#8217;ll be right proud of her, Tom, when she&#8217;s
grown, &#8216;n&#8217; I guess she&#8217;ll be a heap o&#8217; company to you.
Lord!&#8221; with a motherly sigh, &#8220;it seems sorter curi&#8217;s her
bein&#8217; left to a man; but you&#8217;ll do well by her, Tom, you&#8217;ll
do well by her. I hain&#8217;t no doubt o&#8217; that. You was always
mighty clever with children.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do all I can for her,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;though I suppose
that isn&#8217;t much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young woman&mdash;she had left her own baby in the
store with her husband&mdash;patted the little pillow lightly into
shape.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll larn a heap by watchin&#8217; her,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Jest
watch her close &#8216;n&#8217; she&#8217;ll teach you herself. What do you
do about her milk?&#8221; anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been told to do several things,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been told to boil it half an hour and not to boil it at all,
and to give her all she wanted and not to give her all she
wanted. I&#8217;m a little mixed about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I hain&#8217;t had but five, but I&#8217;ve allus let it come
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
to a bile an&#8217; then kinder used my reason about givin&#8217; it.
Seems like the mejumer ye air with children, the better.
But, Lordy! I guess Mornin knows. She raised her young
mistress&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She kissed the child before she left it, and when she reentered
the store, hurriedly took her own struggling offspring
from its father&#8217;s arms, settled its pink dress and
sunbonnet with a nervous, caressing motion, and, carrying
it to the door, stood with it pressed against her breast while
she seemed to be looking out at the distant mountains. She
did not move until her husband had completed his purchases
and came to her. And when she followed him out
to take her place in the waggon, her eyes were bright and
moist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ye take the Blair&#8217;s Holler road, Dave,&#8221; she said,
as he touched up his horses. &#8220;Go round by Jones&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s yer notion, Louizy?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but a notion, I reckon,&#8221; she answered;
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t&mdash;I don&#8217;t want to hev to pass by that thar grave
jest to-day. Take the other road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And being an easy-going, kindly fellow, he humoured her
and went the other way.
</p>
<p>In the store itself the spirit of hilariousness increased
as the day advanced. By mail-time the porch was crowded
and Tom had some slight difficulty in maintaining order.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s got to be quiet here. If
we can&#8217;t carry on the establishment without disturbing the
head of the household at present asleep in the back room,
this post-office has to close and you can get a new postmaster.
That&#8217;d suit you, I daresay. Some fellow, now, that wouldn&#8217;t
half&#8217;tend to his business, not more than half, and that hadn&#8217;t
legislative ability enough to carry on a precinct, let alone
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
a county. You want a man of that kind, I suppose. That&#8217;s
what you&#8217;re working for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; said one of the younger ones, &#8220;bring her out &#8216;n&#8217;
let&#8217;s see her. You&#8217;ve been braggin&#8217; on her all day, but ye
hain&#8217;t let us see her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Half a dozen others joined in the cry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; they said, &#8220;bring her out, Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom did not rise from his seat. He tilted his chair back
and balanced himself on his heels, his hands thrust into his
pockets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring her out on one condition,
and that is that there shall be no shines. I wouldn&#8217;t
have her scared or upset for a good deal. There&#8217;s a joke
in this sort of thing, I daresay; but it ain&#8217;t all joke. If
I bring her out and show her, there&#8217;s to be no crowding
and no row.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was agreed that there should be none, and he left his
chair and went to the inner room again. When he returned,
the men who had been lounging in the porch had come in,
though perhaps not one among them understood his own
unusual interest in the affair. Babies were not rarities in
Hamlin County, every cabin and farm-house in the region
being filled to overflowing with white-headed, sunburnt
youngsters. And yet when Tom appeared there was a moment
of silence. The child was asleep, its tiny black head
resting peacefully against the huge chest of its bearer. There
was no trace of confusion or awkwardness in his face, he
seemed well content with his burden, and perhaps it was
the quiet of his manner as much as anything else which
caused the slight hush to fall upon those around him.
</p>
<p>At last a middle-aged farmer stepped forward. He gave
the child a long and rather curious look.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gal, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; he enquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Tom answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, &#8217;tain&#8217;t a bad thing fer her she&#8217;s got some un to
stan&#8217; by her; gals needs it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom gave her a long look too. She was sleeping very
quietly; it might have been her mother&#8217;s breast she was
lying against.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;here&#8217;s a man to stand by her,&#8221; and then
he raised his head and looked at the rest of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s a promise. Remember it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he carried her back.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p>The rooms at the back had never seemed so quiet before
as when, at the close of the day, he went into them. They
seemed all the quieter by contrast with the excitement of
the past hours. In the kitchen Mornin was giving the final
touches to the supper, and in the room which was at once
sitting-room and bedroom, the wooden cradle had fitted itself
in a corner near the fireplace and wore an air of permanent
establishment remarkable to contemplate when one considered
how unlooked-for an incident it was.
</p>
<p>On the threshold of this apartment Tom paused a moment.
Such silence reigned that he could hear the soft, faint breathing
of the child as it lay asleep. He stopped a second or
so to listen to it. Then he stooped down, and began to
loosen his shoes gently. As he was doing it, Mornin caught
sight of him in passing the open door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mars Tom,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what&#8217;s ye a-gwine fer to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take them off,&#8221; he answered, seriously.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll make too much noise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The good soul in the kitchen chuckled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;now, Mars Tom, dar ye go right now
a-settin&#8217; out to ruinate a good chile, &#8217;stead o&#8217; ustin&#8217; it ter
things&mdash;a-settin&#8217; out ter ruinate it. Don&#8217;t never tip aroun&#8217;
fer no chile. Don&#8217;t ye never do it, &#8216;n&#8217; ye won&#8217;t never haf ter.
Tippin&#8217; roun&#8217; jest spiles &#8217;em. Tell ye, Mornin never tipped
roun&#8217; when she had em&#8217; ter raise. Mornin started out right
from de fust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom looked at the cradle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll rest easier,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And so shall I. I must
get a pair of slippers.&#8221; And he slipped out of his shoes and
stood ready to spend the evening in his stocking-feet. A
solitary tallow candle stood upon the table, shedding its
yellow light upon all surrounding objects to the best of its
ability, and, seeing that its flickering brightness fell upon
the small sleeper&#8217;s face, he placed it at the farther end of
the high mantel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be more comfortable,&#8221; he said. And then sat
down feeling at ease with his conscience.
</p>
<p>Mornin went back to her supper shaking her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By de time she&#8217;s a year old, dar won&#8217;t be no managin&#8217;
her,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Da&#8217;s allus de way wid de men folks, allus
too hard or too soft; better leav&#8217; her to Mornin &#8216;n&#8217; ust&#8217;n her
to things right at de start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There seemed little chance that she would be so &#8220;ustened.&#8221;
Having finished his supper, Tom carried his pipe
and newspaper into the kitchen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sit here awhile,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The smoke might be
too much for her, and the paper rustles so. We&#8217;d better let
her have her sleep out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But when the pipe was out and the last page of the paper
read, he went back to his own room. The small ark stranded
in his chimney corner was attractive enough to draw him
there. It was a stronger attraction than it would have been
to most men. He had always been fond of children and
curious concerning them. There was not a child in the surrounding
region who had not some remembrance of his
rather too lavish good-nature. A visit to the Cross-roads was
often held out as a reward for circumspect behaviour, and
the being denied the treat was considered punishment heavy
enough for most juvenile crimes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ef ye&#8217;d had young uns of yer own, Tom, ye&#8217;d hev ruined
them, shore,&#8221; the secretly delighted matrons frequently remarked.
&#8220;You&#8217;d let &#8217;em run right over ye. I reckon ye
keep that candy thar right a-purpose to feed &#8217;em on now,
don&#8217;t yer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His numerous admirers, whose affection for him was
founded on their enjoyment of his ponderous witticisms
and the humour which was the little leavening of their unexciting
lives, had once or twice during the past few days
found themselves unprepared for, and so somewhat bewildered
by, the new mood which had now and then revealed
itself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kinder outer Tom&#8217;s way to take things like he takes
this; it looks onnat&#8217;ral,&#8221; they said.
</p>
<p>If they had seen him as he drew up to the cradle&#8217;s side,
they would have discovered that they were confronting a
side of the man of which they knew nothing. It was the
man whose youth had been sore-hearted and desolate, while
he had been too humble to realise that it was so, and with
reason. If he had known lonely hours in the past eight
years, only the four walls of the little back room had seen
them. He had always enacted his <i>rôle</i> well outside; but it
was only natural that the three silent rooms must have
seemed too empty now and again. As he bent over the
cradle, he remembered such times, and somehow felt as if
they were altogether things of the past and not to trouble
him again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be life in the place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When she sleeps
less and is old enough to make more noise, it will be quite
cheerful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He spoke with the self-congratulating innocence of inexperience.
A speculative smile settled upon his countenance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When she begins to crawl around and&mdash;and needs looking
after, it will be lively enough,&#8221; he reflected. &#8220;She&#8217;ll
keep us busy, I daresay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a circumstance perhaps worthy of mention that he
never spoke of the little creature as &#8220;it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll need a good deal of looking after,&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;It won&#8217;t do to let her tumble around and take care of
herself, as a boy might. We must be tender of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He bent forward and drew the cover cautiously over the
red flannel sleeve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They think it a good joke, those fellows,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but
it isn&#8217;t a joke with us, is it, young woman? We&#8217;ve a pretty
big job to engineer between us, but I daresay we shall come
out all right. We shall be good friends in the end, and
that&#8217;s a pretty nice thing for a lonely fellow to look forward
to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he arose stealthily and returned to the kitchen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to tell me,&#8221; he said to Mornin, &#8220;what she
needs. I suppose she needs something or other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She needs mos&#8217; ev&#8217;rything, Mars Tom,&#8221; was the answer;
&#8220;seems like she hain&#8217;t bin pervided fer &#8217;t all, no more &#8217;n ef
she was a-gwine ter be a youn&#8217; tukky dat de Lord hisself
hed fitted out at de start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go to Barnesville to-morrow
and talk to Judge Rutherford&#8217;s wife about it. She&#8217;ll know
what she ought to have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And, after a few moments given to apparently agreeable
reflection, he went back to the room he had left.
</p>
<p>He had barely seated himself, however, when he was disturbed
by a low-sounding tap on the side door, which stood
so far open as to allow of any stray evening breeze entering
without reaching the corner of the chimney.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; said Tom, not in a friendly roar, as usual,
but in a discreetly guarded voice.
</p>
<p>The door was pushed gently open and the visitor stood
revealed, blinking with an impartial air at the light
within.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t push it wide open,&#8221; said Tom; &#8220;come in if you
are going to, and leave it as it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps obeyed without making any noise whatever.
It was one of his amiable peculiarities that he never made
any noise, but appeared and disappeared without giving any
warning, making himself very agreeable thereby at inopportune
moments. He slipped in without a sound, deftly left
the door in its previous position, and at once slipped into
a chair, or rather took possession of one, by balancing himself
on the extreme edge of it, arranging his legs on the
lower bar with some dexterity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy?&#8221; he said, meekly, having accomplished this.
</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s manner was not cordial. He stretched himself, put
his hands in his pockets, and made no response to the greeting
which was, upon the whole, a rather unnecessary one,
as Mr. Stamps had been hanging about the post-office
through the whole day, and had only wended his way homeward
a few hours before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Want anything?&#8221; he enquired.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps turned his hat around in his hands hurriedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want nothin&#8217;, Tom,&#8221; he said. Then, after
a pause, he added, very softly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I jest thought I&#8217;d step in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked Tom.
</p>
<p>The hat was turned round again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whar wus I a-gwine?&#8221; deprecatingly. &#8220;Whar? Oh!
I&mdash;I was a-gwine&mdash;I was a-gwine to Marthy&#8217;s, I guess.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re pretty late,&#8221; remarked Tom; &#8220;better lose no
time; it&#8217;s a pretty bad road between here and there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So &#8217;tis,&#8221; replied Mr. Stamps, apparently struck with the
originality of the suggestion. &#8220;So &#8217;tis!&#8221; He appeared to
reflect deeply for a few seconds, but suddenly his eyes began
to wander across the room and rested finally upon the corner
in which the cradle stood. He jerked his head towards it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s thar, is it?&#8221; he enquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s thar,&#8221; Tom answered, rather crustily.
&#8220;What of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! nothin&#8217;, nothin&#8217;, Tom, only it&#8217;s kinder curi&#8217;s&mdash;kinder
curi&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;I&#8217;ve not begun to look at it in that
light yet myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hain&#8217;t ye, now?&#8221; softly. &#8220;Hain&#8217;t ye, Tom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then a faint little chuckle broke from him&mdash;not an intrusive
chuckle, quite the contrary; a deprecatory and inadvertent
sort of chuckle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t me,&#8221; he ventured, inoffensively. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
a-thinkin&#8217; it was curi&#8217;s all along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t going to hurt anybody,&#8221; responded Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, no!&#8221; quite in a hurry. &#8220;Lord, no! &#8217;tain&#8217;t likely;
but it kinder int&#8217;rusted me&mdash;int&#8217;rusted me, findin&#8217; out what
I did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he ended with a gently suggestive cough.
</p>
<p>Tom thrust his hands deeper into his pockets and covered
as large an area of floor with his legs as was possible without
upsetting Mr. Stamps&#8217;s chair and at the same time that
stealthy little man himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! found out!&#8221; he replied, &#8220;Found out h&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He checked himself with much suddenness, glancing at
the cradle as he did so.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What did you find out?&#8221; he demanded, unceremoniously,
and with manifest contempt. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps coughed again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twan&#8217;t much, mebbe,&#8221; he replied, cautiously, &#8220;&#8216;n&#8217; then
again, mebbe &#8217;twas. It was kinder int&#8217;rusting, though. That&mdash;that
thar was a good prayer o&#8217; his&#8217;n, warn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Tom, rather blusteringly. &#8220;I daresay
it was; I suppose you are a better judge of prayers than I
am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a purty good judge on &#8217;em,&#8221; modestly. &#8220;I&#8217;d orter
be, bein&#8217; a class-leader &#8216;n&#8217; uster kinder critykisin&#8217;. I don&#8217;t
never do it much in public myself, but I&#8217;ve allus critikised
them as did. Thet sounded more professionaller then they
air mostly&mdash;unless comin&#8217; frum them, as has bin raised
to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it?&#8221; said Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was more professionaller.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he turned his hat again, setting it more carefully
on his knee. He also fixed his eyes on Tom with a harmless
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They wus North&#8217;ners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom started, but managed to recover himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have mentioned that before,&#8221; he remarked,
with sarcasm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Mr. Stamps, &#8220;along at the start, Tom;
but ye wouldn&#8217;t none on ye believe me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom remembered that this was true, it having been Mr.
Stamps who suggested the Northern theory which had been
so unitedly scouted by his hearers at the time of its propounding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I h&#8217;ain&#8217;t stayed as stiddy in North Car&#8217;lina as the rest
on &#8217;em,&#8221; repeated Mr. Stamps. &#8220;When I was younger, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
kinder launched out wunct. I thought I could make money
faster ef I wus in a more money-makin&#8217;er place, &#8216;n&#8217; I
launched out. I went North a spell &#8216;n&#8217; was thar a right
smart while. I sorter stedded the folks&#8217; ways &#8216;n&#8217; I got to
knowin&#8217; &#8217;em when I seed &#8217;em &#8216;n&#8217; heerd &#8217;em talk. I know&#8217;d
her for one the minit I set eyes on her &#8216;n&#8217; heern her speak.
I didn&#8217;t say nuthin&#8217; much to the rest on ye, &#8217;cause I know&#8217;s
ye&#8217;d make light on it; but I know&#8217;d it wus jest that ar way
with the Northerners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;it&#8217;s valuable information, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps coughed. He turned his hat over and looked
into its greasy and battered crown modestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It mout be,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;&#8216;n&#8217; then again it moughtent.
It moughtent be if thar&#8217; wus nuthin&#8217; else to go &#8217;long with
it. They wus hidin&#8217; sumthin&#8217;, ye know, &#8216;n&#8217; they sot a heap
on keepin&#8217; it hid. Ef a body know&#8217;d the whole thing from
the start, thet&#8217;d be int&#8217;rustin&#8217;, &#8216;n&#8217; it &#8217;ud be vallyable too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Valuable be d&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Tom began, but he checked himself
once more on glancing at the cradle.
</p>
<p>But Mr. Stamps was so far interested that he did not
read the warning he might have read in the suddenly repressed
outbreak. As he neared his goal he became a little
excited and incautious. He leaned forward, blinking rapidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They wasn&#8217;t no man &#8216;n&#8217; wife,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lord, no!
&#8216;N&#8217; ef the two as knowed most on &#8217;em &#8216;n&#8217; was kinder quickest
at readin&#8217; signs &#8217;d kinder go partners &#8216;n&#8217; heve confydence in
one another, &#8216;n&#8217; sorter lay to &#8216;n&#8217; work it out &#8216;n&#8217; foller it up,
it ud be vallybler than stores, or post-offices, or farms to
both on &#8217;em.&#8221; And he leaned so far forward and blinked
so fast that he lost his balance and almost fell off his chair.
</p>
<p>It was Tom who saved him from his fall, but not from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
that tender consideration for his physical security which
such an act would argue. Tom gathered up his legs and
strode across to him almost before he had finished speaking.
For the time being he had apparently forgotten the
cradle and its occupant. He seized the little man by the
back of his collar and lifted him bodily out of his chair
and shook him as a huge mastiff might have shaken a rat,
agitating the little legs in the large trousers with a force
which gave them, for a few seconds, the most active employment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You confounded, sneaking, underhanded little thief!&#8221;
he thundered. &#8220;You damned little scoundrel! You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he bore him out of doors, set him struggling astride
his mule which was cropping the grass, and struck that
sagacious animal a blow upon her quarters which sent her
galloping along the Barnesville Road at a pace which
caused her rider to cling to her neck and body with arms and
legs, in which inconvenient posture he remained, unable
to recover himself, for a distance of at least half a mile.
</p>
<p>Tom returned to the back room in some excitement. As
he crossed the threshold, he was greeted by a shrill cry
from the cradle. He ruefully regarded the patchwork quilt
which seemed to be struggling violently with some unseen
agency.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doggone him!&#8221; he said, innocently, &#8220;he&#8217;s wakened her&mdash;wakened
her, by thunder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he sat down, breathing heavily from his bodily exertion,
and began to rock the cradle with a vigour and gravity
which might have been expected to achieve great results,
if Mornin had not appeared and taken his charge into
her own hands.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p>The next day Tom went to Barnesville. He left the
Cross-roads on horseback early in the morning, and reached
his journey&#8217;s end at noon. He found on arriving at the
town that the story of his undertaking had preceded him.
</p>
<p>When he drew rein before Judge Rutherford&#8217;s house and
having dismounted and tied his horse to the fence, entered
the gate, the Judge&#8217;s wife came out upon the porch to
meet him with her baby in her arms.
</p>
<p>She greeted him with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I must say I am glad to see you.
The Judge brought us a nice story from the country yesterday.
What have you been doing at the Cross-roads?
I told the Judge I didn&#8217;t believe a word of it. There, sit
down in this chair and tell me right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Tom in a business-like manner, &#8220;it&#8217;s
true or I shouldn&#8217;t be here to-day. I&#8217;ve come to ask your
advice about&mdash;well, about things in general.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Rutherford uttered a little cry of delighted curiosity
and surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I never heard such a
thing! Mother!&#8221; turning her head to call to someone in
the room beyond, &#8220;it&#8217;s all true about the baby. Do come
and hear Mr. De Willoughby tell about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sat down on the steps of the porch laughing and yet
regarding Tom with a half sympathetic, half curious look.
It was not the first time she had found him unexpectedly
mysterious.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the father?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t he care for
the poor little thing at all? The Judge heard that he was
so poor that he couldn&#8217;t take care of it. Hadn&#8217;t he any
friends? It has a kind of heartless sound to me&mdash;his going
away that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was poor,&#8221; said Tom, quietly. &#8220;And he had no
relatives who could take the child. He didn&#8217;t know what
to do with it. I&mdash;I think he had a chance of making a
living out West and&mdash;the blow seemed to have stunned
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you took the baby?&#8221; put in Mrs. Rutherford.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Tom answered, &#8220;I took the baby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a pretty baby?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;I think it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just then the Judge&#8217;s mother came out and he was
called upon to tell the story again, when it was received
with interest even more excited and wondering than before.
The older Mrs. Rutherford exclaimed and looked dubious
alternately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you know what to do with it?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;I&#8217;m not. I suppose I shall have
to educate myself up to it gradually. There&#8217;ll be a good
deal to learn, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But he did not appear at all discouraged, and presently
broached the object of his visit, displaying such modest
readiness to accept advice and avail himself of all opportunities
for acquiring valuable information, that his young
hostess was aroused to the deepest admiration, and when
he proceeded to produce quite a large memorandum book
with a view to taking an immediate list of all required articles,
and established rules, she could scarcely contain her
delight.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want to do it all up in the proper way,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Thereupon he was borne into the house and a consultation
of the most serious practical nature was held. Piles
of the last baby&#8217;s pretty garments being produced to illustrate
any obscure point. The sight of those garments with
their embroidery and many frills fired Tom with new enthusiasm.
He could not resist the temptation to pick up
one after another of the prettiest and most elaborate and
hold them out at arm&#8217;s length, his fingers stuck through
the sleeves the better to survey and display them to advantage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he kept saying, &#8220;that&#8217;s the kind of thing she
wants&mdash;pretty and with plenty of frills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He seemed to set his heart especially upon this abundance
of frills and kept it in view throughout the entire arrangements.
Little Mrs. Rutherford was to take charge of the
matter, purchasing all necessaries and superintending the
work of placing it in competent hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, laughing at him delightedly, &#8220;she&#8217;ll be
the best dressed baby in the county.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like her to be among the best,&#8221; said Tom, with a
grave face, &#8220;among the best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whereupon Mrs. Rutherford laughed a little again, and
then quite suddenly stopped and regarded him for a moment
with some thoughtfulness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has some curious notions about that baby, mother,&#8221;
she said afterwards. &#8220;I can see it in all he says.
Everyone mightn&#8217;t understand it. I&#8217;m not sure I do myself,
but he has a big, kind heart, that Tom de Willoughby,
a big, kind heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She understood more clearly the workings of the big,
kind heart before he left them the next morning.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>At night after she had put her child to sleep, she joined
him on the front porch, where he sat in the moonlight, and
there he spoke more fully to her.
</p>
<p>He had seated himself upon the steps of the porch and
wore a deeper reflective air, as he played with a spray of
honeysuckle he had broken from its vine.
</p>
<p>She drew up her rocking-chair and sat down near him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I actually believe you are thinking of that baby now,&#8221;
she said, with a laugh. &#8220;You really look as if you were.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;the fact is that&#8217;s just what I was
doing&mdash;thinking of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and what were you thinking?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking&mdash;&#8221; holding his spray of honeysuckle
between his thumb and forefinger and looking at it in an
interested way, &#8220;I was thinking about what name I should
give her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, &#8220;she hasn&#8217;t any name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Tom answered, without removing his eyes from
his honeysuckle, &#8220;she hasn&#8217;t any name yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;they were queer people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence which she spent in looking
curiously both at him and his honeysuckle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was her mother&#8217;s name?&#8221; she asked at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Rutherford sat up in her chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was dying when I saw her first, and I never thought
of asking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But her father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think of asking that either, and nobody knew
anything of them. I suppose he was not in the frame of
mind to think of such things himself. It was all over and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
done with so soon. He went away as soon as she was
buried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Rutherford sank back into her chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the strangest story I ever heard of in my life,&#8221; she
commented, with a sigh of amazement. &#8220;The man must
have been crazed with grief. I suppose he was very fond of
his wife?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; said Tom.
</p>
<p>There was another pause of a few moments, and from the
thoughts with which they occupied it Mrs. Rutherford
roused herself with a visible effort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, cheerily, &#8220;let it be a pretty name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Tom, &#8220;it must be a pretty one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned the bit of honeysuckle so that the moonlight
fell on its faintly tinted flower. It really seemed as if he
felt he should get on better for having it to look at and
refer to.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want it to be a pretty name,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve
thought of a good many that sounded well enough, but
none of them seemed exactly to hit my fancy in the right
way until I thought of one that came into my mind a few
moments ago as I sat here. It has a pleasant meaning&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s anything in that, of course; but
I&#8217;ve got a sort of whim about it. I suppose it&#8217;s a whim.
What do you think&mdash;&#8221; looking very hard at the honeysuckle,
&#8220;of Felicia?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said his companion, &#8220;that it is likely to be
the best name you could give her, for if she isn&#8217;t a happy
creature it won&#8217;t be your fault.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;I&#8217;ve set out to do my best and I&#8217;d
like to give her a fair start in every way, even in her name,
though there mayn&#8217;t be anything in it, but I&#8217;d like to do it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
I suppose it&#8217;s time I should be having some object in life.
I&#8217;ve never had one before, and I&#8217;ve been a useless fellow.
Well, I&#8217;ve got one now by chance, and I&#8217;m bound to hold
on to it and do what I can. I want her to have what
chances I can give her on her side, and it came into my
mind that Felicia&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped to consult the honeysuckle, as it were, and
Jenny Rutherford broke in:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Felicia is the name for her, and it&#8217;s a
beautiful thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; interrupted Tom, bestirring himself uneasily,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a natural thought. She needs all she can get to balance
the trouble she began life with. Most other little
chaps begin it in a livelier way&mdash;in a way that&#8217;s more natural,
born into a home, and all that. It&#8217;s a desolate business
that she should have no one but a clumsy fellow like
me to pick her up, and that there should be a shadow of&mdash;of
trouble and pain and death over her from the first.
Good Lord!&#8221; with a sudden movement of his big arm,
&#8220;let&#8217;s sweep it away if we can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The thought so stirred him, that he turned quite around
as he sat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s what I was aiming at when
I set my mind on having her things frilled up and ornamented.
I want them to be what they might have been if
she had been born of a woman who was happy and well
cared for and&mdash;and loved&mdash;as if she had been thought of
and looked forward to and provided for in a&mdash;in a tender
way&mdash;as they say young mothers do such things: you know
how that is; I don&#8217;t, perhaps, I&#8217;ve only thought of it sometimes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
his voice suddenly dropping.
</p>
<p>But he had thought of it often, in his lonely back room
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
one winter a few years ago, when it had drifted to him
that his brother De Courcy was the father of a son.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Rutherford leaned forward in her seat, tears rose in
her eyes, and she put her hand impulsively on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you are a good man. You&#8217;re a good
man, and if she lives, she will tell you so and love you with
all her heart. I will see to the little clothes just as if they
were Nellie&#8217;s own&#8221; (Nellie being the baby, or more properly
speaking, the last baby, as there were others in the household).
&#8220;And if there is anything I can ever do for the
little thing, let me do it for her poor young mother&#8217;s sake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom thanked her gratefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to come to you often enough, I reckon,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I guess she&#8217;ll have her little sick spells, as they
all do, and it&#8217;ll help wonderfully to have someone to call
on. There&#8217;s her teeth now,&#8221; anxiously, &#8220;they&#8217;ll be coming
through in a few months, and then there&#8217;ll be the deuce to
pay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was so overweighted by this reflection, that he was
silent for some minutes afterwards and was only roused by
a question requiring a reply.
</p>
<p>Later the Judge came in and engaged him in political
conversation, all the Judge&#8217;s conversation being of a political
nature and generally tending to vigorous denunciations
of some candidate for election who belonged to the
opposite party. In Barnesville political feeling ran high,
never running low, even when there was no one to be
elected or defeated, which was very seldom the case, for
between such elections and defeat there was always what had
been done or what ought to have been done at Washington
to discuss, it being strongly felt that without the assistance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
of Barnesville, Washington would be in a sorry plight indeed.
</p>
<p>To-day the Judge had been engaged in a livelier discussion
than usual as he rode homeward with a select party
of legal brethren from court at Brownsboro, and consequently
made his appearance blustering and joyous. He
bestowed upon his wife a sounding kiss, and, with one arm
around her waist, shook hands with Tom in a gust of hospitality,
speaking to both at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, Jenny? Howdy, Tom? It&#8217;s a coon&#8217;s age since
we&#8217;ve seen you, Tom. Time you showed yourself. How
are the children, Jenny&mdash;and what&#8217;s Tom Scott been doing?
What&#8217;s this we hear about that stray young one?
Nice tale that is to tell on a fellow. Fowler heard it at
Brownsboro and like to have killed himself. Lord! how
hot it&#8217;s been! I&#8217;m ready for supper, Jenny. Sit down,
Tom. As soon as I get through supper, we&#8217;ll have a real
old-fashioned talk. I&#8217;ve been suffering for one for three
months. Jenny, tell Sophronia to spread herself on her
waffles, for I&#8217;ve been getting some mighty poor stuff for the
last few days. What do you think of Thatcher running for
the Legislature? Lord! Lord! what a fool that fellow is!
Most unpopular man in the county, and about the meanest
too. Mean? Lord! mean ain&#8217;t the name for it! He&#8217;ll be
beat so that any other man wouldn&#8217;t want to show his head,
and it won&#8217;t make a mark on him. Nellie&#8217;s asleep, ain&#8217;t
she, Jenny? I&#8217;ve got to go and look at her and the rest of
them. Don&#8217;t you want to come along, Tom? You&#8217;re a family
man yourself now, and you ought to take an interest!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led the way into the family-room at the back and, taking
the candle from the high mantel, moved it triumphantly
over the beds in which the children slept.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Tom Scott!&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Tom Scott&#8217;s got
to have a crib to himself. Look at him now. What do you
think of that for a boy? He&#8217;s five years old next month,
and he about runs Barnesville. The boys round here are
just ruining him with making much of him and setting
him up to tricks. He just lives round at the stores and the
post-office. And what Tom Scott don&#8217;t know ain&#8217;t worth
knowing. Came home with six jack-knives in his pockets
the first day Jenny turned him out in pantaloons. The
boys tried themselves to see who could do best by him.
You could hear them shouting and laughing all over the
town at the things they got him to say. I tell you he&#8217;s a
case, Tom is. Last election he was as stirred up as any of
us. Hollered &#8216;&#8217;Rah for Collins&#8217; until he was hoarse and
his mother brought him home and gave him syrup of squills
because she thought he had the croup. What do you think
he did, now? Went into Barton&#8217;s store and ordered a
bushel of chestnuts to be sent down to my account and
brought &#8217;em out and set on the horse-block and gave a treat
for Collins. I was coming up home and saw the crowd and
heard the hollering and laughing, and there was Tom in
the middle baling out his chestnuts and hollering at the top
of his voice: &#8216;Come on, boys, all you Collins men, here&#8217;s
a treat for Collins!&#8217; I thought Collins would have died
when he heard it. He laughed until he choked, and the
next day he came to see Tom and gave him a gold eagle
and a colt. He says he is going to give him a little nigger to
look after it, and he&#8217;ll do it. Oh, Tom Scott&#8217;s the boy!
He&#8217;ll be in the White House forty years from now. He&#8217;s
making a bee-line for it right now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he bent and kissed the little fellow&#8217;s sunburnt rosy
cheek.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;His mother and his grandmother can&#8217;t do a thing with
him,&#8221; he said, rapturously, &#8220;and it&#8217;s as much as I can do
to manage him. Oh, he&#8217;s a case, is Tom Scott!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And with this tribute to his character, he left him to his
slumbers, with his sturdy little legs occupying an extensive
area of crib and his face resting on his small brown arm.
</p>
<p>After this, the Judge went to his supper and consumed
a large quantity of fried chicken, waffles, and coffee, afterwards
joining Tom on the porch, smoking his pipe and
stigmatising Thatcher in a loud and jovial voice as the
meanest man in Hamlin.
</p>
<p>But for this resonant jovialness of voice, his denunciation
of the Democratic Party, which was not his party,
might have appeared rather startling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t an honest man among them,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;Not a durned one! They&#8217;re all the same. Cut
each other&#8217;s throats for a dime, the whole caboodle. Oh!
damn a Democrat anyhow, Tom, &#8217;tain&#8217;t in the nature of
things that they should be anything but thieves and rascals.
Just look at the whole thing. It&#8217;s founded on lies
and corruption and scoundrelism. That&#8217;s their foundation.
They start out on it, and it ain&#8217;t reasonable to expect
anything better of them. Good Lord! If I thought
Tom Scott would join the Democrats, I believe I&#8217;d blow his
brains out in his crib this minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s part in this discussion was that of a large-minded
and strictly impartial listener. This was the position he
invariably assumed when surrounded by political argument.
He was not a politician. His comments upon political
subjects being usually of a sarcastic nature, and
likely to prove embarrassing to both parties.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said in reply to the Judge&#8217;s outpourings,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
&#8220;you&#8217;re right. There ain&#8217;t a chance for them, not an
eternal chance. You can&#8217;t expect it, and it ain&#8217;t all their
fault either. Where are they to get their decent men from,
unless some of you fellows go over? Here you are without
a liar or a fool among you&mdash;not a durned one&mdash;made
a clean sweep of all the intellect and honesty and incorruptible
worth in the country and hold on to it too, and
then let out on these fellows because there isn&#8217;t any left
for &#8217;em. I&#8217;m a lazy man myself and not much on argument,
but I must say that&#8217;s a weak place in your logic.
You don&#8217;t give &#8217;em a show at the start&mdash;that&#8217;s their misfortune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, go to thunder!&#8221; roared the Judge, amiably. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t know the first thing about it and never did. That&#8217;s
where you fail&mdash;in politics. The country would be in a
mighty poor fix if we had many fellows like you&mdash;in a
mighty poor fix. You&#8217;re a good citizen, Tom, but you ain&#8217;t
a politician.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t good enough for your
party or bad enough for the other, when a man&#8217;s got to be
either a seraphim or a Democrat, there isn&#8217;t much chance
for an ordinary fellow to spread himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whereupon the Judge in an altogether friendly manner
consigned him to thunder again and, evidently enjoying
himself immensely, proceeded to the most frightful denunciations
of Thatcher and his party, the mere list of
whose crimes and mental incapacities should have condemned
them to perdition and the lunatic asylum upon the
spot without further delay.
</p>
<p>While he was in the midst of this genial loud-voiced
harangue, his wife, who had been in the back room with
the baby, came out and, on seeing her, he seemed suddenly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
to forget his animosities and the depraved political condition
of the country altogether, becoming a placable, easily
pleased, domesticated creature at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Got Nellie to sleep again, have you?&#8221; he said, putting
his hand on her shoulder. &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go in and have
some music. Come and sing &#8216;The Last Rose of Summer.&#8217;
That&#8217;s my favourite; it beats all the new-fangled opera
things all to pieces.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led the way into the parlour, which was a large square
room, regarded by Barnesville as the most sumptuous of
reception chambers, inasmuch as its floor was covered by a
Brussels carpet adorned with exotics of multifarious colours,
its walls ornamented with massively framed photographs,
and its corners fitted up with whatnots and shining
hair-cloth seats known in Hamlin County as &#8220;tater-tates,&#8221;
and in that impressive character admired beyond expression.
Its crowning glory, however, was the piano, which
had belonged to Jenny Rutherford in her boarding-school
days, and was the delight of the Judge&#8217;s heart. It furnished
him with his most cherished recreation in his
hours of repose from political conflict and argument, inasmuch
as he regarded his wife&#8217;s performance seldom to be
equalled and never surpassed, and the soft, pleasant voice
with which she sang &#8220;The Last Rose of Summer&#8221; and
other simple and sentimental melodies as that of a cantatrice
whose renown might have been world-wide if she
had chosen to turn her attention to its development.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; he said, throwing himself into one of the shining
arm-chairs. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like music, nothing under
the shining sun. &#8216;Music hath charms to soothe the
savage breast.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>This in his most sonorous quotation tones: &#8220;Let a man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
get tired or out of sorts, or infernal mad at a pack of
cursed fools, and music&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;ll set him straight
every time, if he&#8217;s any sort of a fellow. A man that ain&#8217;t
fond of music ain&#8217;t of any account on God&#8217;s green earth. I
wouldn&#8217;t trust him beyond a broom-straw. There&#8217;s a mean
streak in a man that don&#8217;t care for music, sure. Why, the
time the Democrats elected Peyton, the only thing that
saved me from bursting a blood-vessel was Jenny&#8217;s playing
&#8216;My Lodging&#8217;s on the Cold Ground&#8217; with variations.
I guess she played it for two hours hand-running, because
when I found it was sort of soothing me, I didn&#8217;t want her
to break in on the effect by beginning another. Play it
for Tom, Jenny, after you&#8217;ve sung awhile. There&#8217;s one
thing I&#8217;ve made up my mind to&mdash;if I had fifty girls, I&#8217;d
have &#8217;em all learn music if they didn&#8217;t know anything&mdash;not
the operatic kind, you know, but enough to teach them to
sing to a man like Jenny does. Go on, Jenny.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sustaining and cheering effects of Sophronia&#8217;s fried
chicken and waffles probably added to his comfortable enjoyment,
which was without limit. He leaned back in his
armchair as far as the stiffly ornamented back would admit
of his so doing and kept time with his head or his feet, occasionally
joining in on a chorus with startling suddenness
in an evidently subdued roar, which, though subdued, was
still roaring enough, and, despite the excellence of its intention,
quite out of tune enough to cause the wax flowers
in their wax basket on the table (both done by Jenny at
boarding-school) to shake under the glass shade until they
tapped against its side with a delicate tinkle.
</p>
<p>It was while this was going on that Tom, sitting near a
side table, picked up a book and almost unconsciously
opened it and read its title. Having read its title, an expression
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
of interest showed itself on his countenance and
he turned over a leaf or so, and as he turned them over
dipped into them here and there.
</p>
<p>He had the book in his hand when Jenny Rutherford
ended her last chorus and came towards him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you go much by this?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>She took it from him and glanced at it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought Tom Scott up on it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mother
wasn&#8217;t with me then, and I was such a child I did not know
what to do with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to be a good sort of book,&#8221; said Tom, and he
turned over the leaves again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; she answered, smiling at him. &#8220;There are lots
of things in it every doctor don&#8217;t know. It was written by
a woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the reason, I reckon,&#8221; said Tom.
</p>
<p>He laid the book down and seemed to forget it, but about
an hour after when his bedroom candle was brought and
he was on the point of retiring for the night, he turned
upon the threshold of the sitting-room and spoke to his
hostess in the tone of one suddenly recollecting himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you say you got that book?&#8221; he inquired,
snuffing his candle with his thumb and forefinger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say at all,&#8221; answered Jenny. &#8220;I got it from
Brough &amp; Bros., Baltimore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there!&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he reached his room and shut himself in, he set
his candlestick on a table and proceeded to draw from his
pocket the memorandum-book, also producing the stump of
a lead pencil.
</p>
<p>Then he made as he stood up before the looking-glass
and in the flickering light of the candle, an entry which was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
as follows: &#8220;Advice to Young Mothers, Brough &amp; Bros.&#8221;
He made it with a grave countenance and a business-like
manner, and somehow, owing it may be to the small size of
the room, its low ceilings and many shadows, or the flickering
of the candle, his colossal height and breadth of body
and tremendous look of strength had never seemed so
marked nor appeared so to overpower the objects surrounding
him.
</p>
<p>Having completed the entry, he shut up the book and returned
it to his pocket with a relieved air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If a man ain&#8217;t a young mother,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;I guess
he can get the good of it, if he gives himself time. And
what she wants&#8221;&mdash;rather hurriedly&mdash;&#8220;is to get as good
a start as if she had a young mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he sat down and pulled off his right boot in so absorbed
a frame of mind, that he aroused presently with a
start to find that he was holding it as if it had been made
of much less tough material and required handling tenderly.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>He was on his way homeward early the next morning,
and by noon his horse had climbed the rising ground from
which he could look down on the Cross-roads and the post-office
baking itself brown in the sun. Catching sight of the
latter edifice, he smiled a little and shook the bridle against
his steed&#8217;s warm neck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get along, Jake,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m in a little more of a
hurry to get home than usual&mdash;seems that way anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The eagerness he felt was a new experience with him and
stirred his sense of humour even while it warmed his always
easily moved heart. It had been his wont during the
last eight years to return from any absence readily but
never eagerly or with any touch of excited pleasure. Even
at their brightest aspect, with the added glow of fire and
warmth and good cheer, and contrast to winter&#8217;s cold and
appetite sharpened by it, the back rooms had always suffered
from the disadvantage of offering no prospect of
companionship or human interest to him. After the supper
had been disposed of and the newspapers read and the pipe
smoked, there had only been the fire to watch, and it was
quite natural to brood as its blaze died down and its logs
changed to a bed of glowing cinders. Under such circumstances
it was easy to fall into a habit of brooding too
much and thinking of things which had better been forgotten.
When there was no fire, it had been lonelier still,
and he had found the time hang heavily, on his hands.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But now,&#8221; he said, shaking his bridle again, &#8220;there
she is, and it&#8217;s quite queer, by thunder, how much she
seems to give a man to think of and what will it be when
she begins to talk.&#8221; And his smile ended in a jovial laugh
which rather startled Jake, who was not expecting it, and
caused him to shy promptly.
</p>
<p>She was not asleep when he entered her presence, which
was so unusual a state of affairs that he found it a little
alarming.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing wrong, I
hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wid dat chile?&#8221; chuckled Mornin, delightedly. &#8220;I
sh&#8217;d think not, Mars&#8217; D&#8217;Willerby! Dat ar chile&#8217;s a-thrivin&#8217;
an&#8217; a-comin&#8217; &#8217;long jes&#8217; like she&#8217;d orter. Dar ain&#8217;t a-gwine
to be nothin&#8217; wrong wid dat chile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good thing,&#8221; said Tom.
</p>
<p>He sat down by the cradle&#8217;s side and regarded its occupant
with an interest as fresh as if she had just appeared
for the first time upon his horizon. She had been imbibing
a large quantity of milk, and the effect of this nourishment
had been to at once compose her spirits and slightly
enliven them. So she employed the passing moments by
looking at Tom with steadfast and solemn eyes&mdash;not, perhaps,
very intelligently, but still with a vacant air of interest
in him in his character of an object.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, &#8220;she&#8217;s grown; she&#8217;s grown in thirty-six
hours, and she&#8217;s improved too. Oh, yes! she&#8217;s coming
along nicely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He touched her very carefully with his large forefinger,
a liberty which she did not resent or even notice, unless the
fact that she winked both eyes might be regarded as a token
of recognition.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a box full of things here for her in a couple
of weeks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And then she can start out in life&mdash;start
out in life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The last four words seemed to please him; as he repeated
them he touched her cheek again, carefully as before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And start out fair, too!&#8221; he added. &#8220;Fair and square&mdash;as
fair and square as any of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He remained a little longer in his seat by the cradle,
talking to Mornin, asking her questions and delivering messages
laden with advice from little Mrs. Rutherford, which
instructions Aunt Mornin plainly regarded as superfluous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mars&#8217; D&#8217;Willerby,&#8221; she giggled in amiable scorn,
&#8220;didn&#8217;t I raise fo&#8217; o&#8217; my young Mistes&#8217;s? Mornin ain&#8217;t no
spring chicken. Dar ain&#8217;t nuffin &#8217;bout chillun Mornin
h&#8217;aint heerd. Leeve dis yere chile to Mornin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t going to be left to anyone,&#8221; said Tom, cheerfully,
&#8220;not to the best woman in Hamlin County. We&#8217;ve
got to make up to her for two or three things, and we&#8217;re
going to do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Having relieved himself of which sentiment, he went to
his place at the table and ate a mighty dinner, during his
enjoyment of which meal he did not lose interest in his
small silent partner at all, but cast proud glances and
jocular sallies at her every few mouthfuls, partaking of her,
as it were, with his mountain trout, and finding her add
flavour and zest to his hot corn-bread and fried ham.
</p>
<p>When he had ended his repast with an astonishing
draught of buttermilk, and was ready to go into the store,
she had dozed off cosily again and was making the best of
her opportunities, so he only paused for a moment to give
her a farewell glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Felicia&mdash;that&#8217;ll do. When you come
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
to the meaning of it, I don&#8217;t know of anything else that&#8217;d
seem to start her out as fair&mdash;Felicia!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And though he said the word in a whisper it seemed to
reach her ear in some mysterious way, for she stirred
slightly, though not as through any sense of disturbance,
opened her eyes upon his big figure and, closing them the
next instant, sank into soft sleep again with the faintest
dawn or ghost of a baby smile upon her face.
</p>
<p>So, nestling under the patchwork quilt and sleeping the
hours away in the small ark stranded in the chimney corner,
she began life.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Felicia was received by Talbot&#8217;s Cross-roads with some
difference of opinion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather had Mirandy or Lucretia,&#8221; said Mrs. Doty.
&#8220;Flishyer ain&#8217;t nigh as showy as a heap o&#8217; other names,
&#8216;n&#8217; like as not, folks&#8217;ll be callin&#8217; her F&#8217;lish. Now thar&#8217;s
Vangerline &#8216;n&#8217; Clementine &#8216;n&#8217; Everlyne that&#8217;d ha&#8217; bin
showier then Flishyer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; put in Mr. Doty, with his usual enjoyment of
his friend&#8217;s weakness and strength, &#8220;Tom he&#8217;d a notion
&#8217;bout it. He said it meant som&#8217;n &#8217;bout her a&#8217;bein&#8217; happy,
&#8216;n&#8217; he &#8217;lowed it&#8217;d kinder give her a start in the right direction.
It&#8217;s jes&#8217; like Tom. He&#8217;s full o&#8217; notions when he gits
started. I&#8217;ll back him agin any man in Hamlin fur notions
when he gits started. Lord! it&#8217;s jes&#8217; Tom all over!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Through a disposition to take even names easily and
avoid in all cases any unnecessary exertion, Mrs. Doty&#8217;s
pronunciation was adopted at once, which was perhaps the
principal reason for a fanciful change being made not long
afterwards.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>Against &#8220;F&#8217;lishyer&#8221; Tom rebelled loudly and without
ceasing, but without effect.
</p>
<p>The fanciful change came about and was adopted in this
wise. In the course of a couple of weeks the box of little
garments arrived from Barnesville, accompanied by a
warm-hearted note from Jenny Rutherford.
</p>
<p>The unpacking of the box&mdash;which was not a large one,
though it seemed to contain an astonishing number of
things, most of them of great length and elaborateness&mdash;was
to Tom a singularly exciting event, so exciting that he
found himself wondering and not at all sure that he understood
it.
</p>
<p>When he opened the box&mdash;Mornin standing at his side,
her charge in her arms&mdash;he did it with tremulous fingers,
and when, having laid one article after another in a snowy
drift upon the bed, he drew back to look at them, he found
it necessary after a few moments&#8217; inspection to turn about
and pace the floor, not uneasily, but to work off steam as
it were, while Mornin uttered her ejaculations of rapture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never seen nuthin&#8217; like &#8217;em afore, Mars&#8217; D&#8217;Willerby,&#8221;
she said with many excitable giggles. &#8220;Dis yer chile&#8217;s
a-gwine to take the flo&#8217; shore as yo&#8217; bawn! Sich a settin&#8217;
out as dat is! She&#8217;ll git ter puttin&#8217; on airs afore she&#8217;s a
year ole. We&#8217;ll hev ter give her a settin&#8217; down wunce &#8217;n a
while to keep her straight. Mis&#8217; Rutherford, she wus boun&#8217;
to do it up in style, she wus!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom took one hand out of his pocket and ruffled his hair
with it, and then put it back again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your young mistresses now,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;I suppose
they are about such things as their mothers made for
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lordy, dey&#8217;s a heap finer, Mars&#8217; D&#8217;Willerby&mdash;a heap
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
finer! Dey wus rich folks&#8217; chillun, but dey never hed sich
a settin&#8217; out as dis yere&mdash;not one on &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t?&#8221; said Tom, with secretly repressed exultation.
&#8220;Well, if they didn&#8217;t, I guess she&#8217;ll do. They are
rather nice, I reckon&mdash;and I meant they should be. Say,
Mornin, suppose you dress her up and let me show her to
the boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He himself picked out the sumptuous long-skirted garments
she was to wear and watched with the deepest interest
the rather slow process of her attiring. He was particularly
pleased with a wonderfully embroidered white
cloak and lace cap, which latter article he abstractedly tied
on his great fist and found much too small for it. His triumph,
when she was given to his arms, he did not attempt
to conceal, but carried her into the store with the manner
of a large victor bearing his spoils.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, boys,&#8221; he announced, being greeted
with the usual laughter and jocular remarks. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t
the style of thing we want. Hand a man a chair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His customary support being produced, he seated himself
in it, keeping his charge balanced with a dexterity and
ease quite wonderful to behold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What we want,&#8221; he proceeded, &#8220;is a more respectful
tone. Something in the elaborate chivalric style, and we&#8217;re
going to have it. What we want is to come into this establishment
feeling that there&#8217;s no risk of our being scared
or upset by any durned fool startling us and setting our
delicate machinery wrong. We&#8217;ve come here to stay, and
we expect to be more familiar with things as we grow
older, and the thing for us is to start out right without any
disagreeable impressions. We don&#8217;t want to say when we&#8217;re
brought in here&mdash;&#8216;Why, here&#8217;s the place where that fool
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
gave me such a start last week. I wonder if he&#8217;s here
again?&#8217; What we want is to feel that here&#8217;s a place that&#8217;s
home, and a place that a person&#8217;s likely to look forward
to coming to with the view to ah&mdash;I should say to a high
old time of an agreeable description.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; to be a doggoned purty critter,&#8221; said a
lounger who sat on a barrel near by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t nuthin&#8217; like her mother,&#8221; said another;
&#8220;though she wus a purty critter when I seed her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had only seen her in her coffin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t like her father,&#8221; put in another.
</p>
<p>Tom moved in his chair uneasily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t be like either of them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let that
go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a tone in his voice which more than one among
them had now and again noticed with some slow bewilderment
during the last few weeks&mdash;a tone new to them, but
which in time they grew used to, though they never understood
its meaning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kinder,&#8221; they used to say, &#8220;as ef he wus mad or&mdash;ruffed
up, though it warn&#8217;t that exactly, either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Black eyes, h&#8217;ain&#8217;t she?&#8221; inquired the man on the
barrel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An har. That&#8217;s my kind er women, black eyes an&#8217;
har, and kinder spirity. They&#8217;ve more devil to &#8217;em &#8216;n&#8217; is
better able to take care of &#8217;emselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got some one to take care of her,&#8221; answered Tom.
&#8220;That&#8217;s my business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got her mightily fixed up, Tom,&#8221; remarked Mr.
Doty, who had just entered. &#8220;You&#8217;ll hev all the women
in the country flocking up. She sorter makes me think o&#8217;
the Queen o&#8217; Sheby. Sheby, she wus great on fixin&#8217;.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>Every man who entered, seeing her as she lay in state
in Tom&#8217;s lap, was drawn towards her to stand and wonder
at her vaguely. There developed a tendency to form small
and rather silent groups about her. Infancy was no novelty
in this region of numerous progenies, but the fine softness
of raiment and delicate sumptuousness of infancy were.
More than one man, having looked at her and wandered
away, was unable to resist the temptation to wander back
again and finally to settle in some seat or box upon a barrel,
that he might the better indulge his curiosity and interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye must hev spent a heap on her, Tom,&#8221; was said
respectfully again and again.
</p>
<p>The fact that &#8220;a heap had been spent on her&#8221; inspired
the audience with a sense of her importance, which
amounted to reverence. That she represented an apparently
unaccountable expenditure, was considered to reflect
credit upon her, however vaguely, and to give her a value
not to be lightly regarded. To Mr. Doty the idea of the
&#8220;Queen of Sheby&#8221; appeared to recur persistently, all his
imaginings of the poetic, the dramatic, and luxurious being
drawn from Scriptural sources.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think o&#8217; nuthin&#8217; else but Sheby when I look at
her,&#8221; he remarked several times. &#8220;She &#8217;minds me more
o&#8217; Sheby then anything else &#8217;n Scripter. Minty&#8217;ll jest hev
to come ter see her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This boldness of imagery struck a chord in the breast of
his hearers which responded at once. It was discovered
that more than one of them had been reminded in some
indefinite manner of the same distinguished personage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When she was consider&#8217;ble younger then in Solomon&#8217;s
time,&#8221; said one gentleman with much solemnity.
</p>
<p>Tom himself was caught by the fancy and when his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
charge was referred to occasionally in a most friendly spirit
as &#8220;Sheby thar,&#8221; he made no protest against it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a thunderation sight better than &#8216;Flishyer,&#8217;&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and if it comes easier to you fellows, I&#8217;ve no objection.
Sheba ain&#8217;t bad. There&#8217;s a kind of swing to it, and
you can&#8217;t get it very far wrong. The other&#8217;s a good name
spoiled, and it&#8217;s a name I&#8217;ve a fancy for saving for her. I
gave it to her&mdash;I&#8217;ll save it for her, and it shall be a thing
between us two. Call her Sheba if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So it fell out that Mr. Doty&#8217;s Oriental imaginings sealed
her fate and gradually, by a natural process, Felicia was
abandoned for Sheba, even Tom using it upon all ordinary
occasions.
</p>
<p>Having in this manner begun life, a day rarely passed
in which she did not spend an hour or so in the post-office.
Each afternoon during the first few months of her existence
Tom brought her forth attired in all her broidery, and it
was not long before the day came when he began to cherish
the fancy that she knew when the time for her visit was
near, and enjoyed it when it came.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She looks as if she did,&#8221; he said to Mornin. &#8220;She
wouldn&#8217;t go to sleep yesterday after I came into the room,
and I&#8217;ll swear I saw her eyes following me as I walked
about; and when I carried her in after she was dressed, she
turned her head over her shoulder to look round her and
smiled when she had done it and found nothing was missing.
Oh! she knows well enough when she gets in there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fancy was a wonderfully pleasant one to him, and
when, as time went on, she developed a bright baby habit
of noticing all about her, and expressing her pleasure in
divers soft little sounds, he was a happier man than he had
ever thought to be. His greatest pleasure was the certain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
knowledge that she had first noticed himself&mdash;that her first
greeting had been given to him, that her first conscious
caress had been his. She was a loving little creature, showing
her affection earlier than most children do. Before
she could sit upright, she recognised his in-comings and
out-goings, and when he took her in his arms to walk to
and fro with her, as was his habit at night, she dropped
her tiny head upon his shoulders with a soft yielding to
his tenderness which never failed to quicken the beatings
of his heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something in her face,&#8221; he used to say to himself,
&#8220;something that&#8217;s not in every child&#8217;s face. It&#8217;s a
look about her eyes and mouth that seems to tell a man that
she understands him&mdash;whether his spirits are up or down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But his spirits were not often down in those days. The
rooms at the back no longer wore an air of loneliness, and
the evenings never hung heavily on his hands. In the
course of a few months he sent to Brownsboro for a high
chair and tried the experiment of propping his small companion
up in it at his side when he ate his supper. It was
an experiment which succeeded very well and filled him
with triumph. From her place in the kitchen Mornin
could hear during every meal the sound of conversation
of the most animated description. Tom&#8217;s big, kind voice
rambling cheerily and replied to by the soft and unformed
murmuring of the child. He was never tired of her, never
willing to give her up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I might have given to others if they&#8217;d cared for
it,&#8221; was his thought, &#8220;I give to her and she knows it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed too that she did know it, that from her first
gleaming of consciousness she had turned to him as her
friend, her protector, and her best beloved. When she

heard his footsteps, she turned in Mornin&#8217;s arms, or in her
cradle, to look for him, and when she saw his face her whole
little body yearned towards him.
</p>
<p>One afternoon when she was about eight months old, he
left her at the usual time. Mornin, who was working, had
spread a big red shawl upon the floor and seated her upon
it, and when Tom went out of the room, she sat still playing
in the quiet way peculiar to her, with the gay fringe.
She gave him a long earnest look as he crossed the threshold,
a look which he remembered afterwards as having been
more thoughtful than usual and which must have represented
a large amount of serious speculation mingled with
desire.
</p>
<p>Tom went into the store, and proceeded to the performance
of his usual duty of entertaining his customers. He
was in a jovial mood, and, having a larger number of visitors
than ordinarily, was kept actively employed in settling
the political problems of the day and disposing of all
public difficulties.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s most wanted at the head of things,&#8221; he proclaimed,
&#8220;is a man that&#8217;s capable of exerting himself (Mis&#8217;
Doty, if you choose that calico, Job can cut it off for you!)
a man who ain&#8217;t afraid of work. (Help yourself, Jim!)
Lord! where&#8217;d this post-office be if some men had to engineer
it&mdash;a man who would stand at things and loaf instead
of taking right hold. (For Heaven&#8217;s sake, Bill, don&#8217;t
hurry! Jake&#8217;ll give you the tea as soon as he&#8217;s cut off his
wife&#8217;s dress!) That&#8217;s the kind of men we want in office
now&mdash;in every kind of office&mdash;in every kind of office. If
there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve no use for on God&#8217;s green earth, it&#8217;s
a man with no energy. (Nicholson, just kick that box
over here so I can get my feet on it!)&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>He was sitting near the door which connected the back
part of the establishment with the front, and it was just
at this juncture that there fell upon his ear a familiar sound
as of something being dragged over the floor. The next
moment he felt his foot touched and then pressed upon by
some soft unsteady weight.
</p>
<p>He looked down with a start and saw first a small round
face upturned, its dark eyes tired but rejoicing and faithful,
and then a short white dress much soiled and dusted
by being dragged over the bare boards of the two storerooms.
</p>
<p>His heart gave a leap and all the laughter died out of
his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, boys!&#8221; he said, as he bent down, &#8220;she&#8217;s followed
me! She&#8217;s followed me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was quite true. She had never crawled far beyond
the limits of the shawl before, but this morning her longing
had given her courage and strength, and she had set out
upon her journey in search of him.
</p>
<p>Those about him burst into loud, admiring laughter, but
Tom did not laugh at all. He lifted the child to his knee
and held her encircled by one arm. She was weary with
her exertion and settled at once into an easy sitting posture,
her head resting against him while she gazed quietly from
under her upcurled lashes at the faces grouped about her.
Their laughter did not disturb her now that she had
reached her haven of safety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To think of her a-followin&#8217; him!&#8221; said Mis&#8217; Doty, &#8220;&#8216;n&#8217;
her never sot off nowhars afore. The purty little critter!
Lord! Tom, she&#8217;s a-gwine ter be a sight when she&#8217;s grown&mdash;with
them eyes and har! An&#8217; ter think of her a-slippin&#8217;
off from Mornin an&#8217; makin&#8217; up her little mind to follow ye.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
I&#8217;ve never had a young &#8217;un to try it that early in all I&#8217;ve
raised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lordy!&#8221; said Mr. Doty, &#8220;she&#8217;s as sot on Tom &#8217;s he&#8217;s
on her, &#8216;n&#8217; ef ever a man wus a doggoned fool about a young
&#8217;un, he is about that&#8217;n; &#8216;n&#8217; fur bein&#8217; a doggoned fool&#8221;&mdash;triumphantly&mdash;&#8220;when
he sets out ter be, I&#8217;ll back Tom
agin any man in Hamlin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom said but little. He made no more jokes. He kept
the child with him through the rest of the day, holding
her upon his knee or carrying her out upon the porch.
</p>
<p>When at supper-time he carried her back to the room,
she was asleep and he laid her in her cradle himself. He
moved about very quietly afterwards and ate his supper
alone with frequent glances at the sleeper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take her away,&#8221; he said to Mornin when she
came in; &#8220;leave her here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;N&#8217; hev her a-wakin&#8217; &#8216;n&#8217; disturbin&#8217; uv ye, Mars&#8217; Tom!&#8221;
she responded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave her here,&#8221; he said, laying his hand on the head
of the cradle. &#8220;She&#8217;ll not disturb me. We shall get along
finely together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was left, Mornin taking her departure with manifest
disbelief in the practicability of the plan. And then, having
drawn the cradle to his bedside, Tom put out the light
and retired himself.
</p>
<p>But he did not sleep for some time; having flung his
mighty body upon the couch, he lay with his arms thrown
above his head gazing at the darkness and listening to the
soft breathing at his side. He was thinking over the one
event of the day.
</p>
<p>What might have seemed a slight thing to many men
had struck deep into his great heart.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he said, a touch of reverential tone in his
whisper, &#8220;to think of her following me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he stretched out his hand in the darkness and laid
it upon the side of the cradle lightly, and afterwards fell
asleep.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p>Just at this time, which was the year before the Civil
War, that fashionable summer resort, the White Briar
Springs, was at its gayest. Rarely before had the hotel
been filled with so brilliant a company. A few extra cases
of yellow fever had been the cause of an unusual exodus
from the fever districts, and in consequence the various
summer resorts flourished and grew strong. The &#8220;White
Briar&#8221; especially exerted and arrayed itself in its most
festive garments. The great dining-room was filled to
overflowing, the waiters were driven to desperation by the
demands made upon them as they flew from table to table
and endeavoured with laudable zeal to commit to memory
fifty orders at once and at the same time to answer
&#8220;Comin&#8217;, sah&#8221; to the same number of snapped fingers.
There were belles from Louisiana, beauties from Mississippi,
and enslavers from Virginia, accompanied by their
mothers, their fathers, their troops of younger brothers
and sisters, and their black servants. There were nurses
and valets and maids of all shades from ebony to cream-colour,
and of all varieties of picturesqueness. All day
the immense piazzas were crowded with promenaders,
sitters, talkers, fancy-workers, servants attired in rainbow
hues and apparently enjoying their idleness or their pretence
at work to the utmost. Every morning parties
played ten-pins, rode, strolled, gossipped; every afternoon
the daring few who did not doze away the heated hours in
the shaded rooms, flirted in couples under trees on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
lawn, or in the woods, or by the creek. Every evening
there was to be found ardent youth to dance in the ballroom,
and twice a week at least did this same youth,
arrayed in robes suited to honour the occasion, disport
itself joyfully and with transcendent delight in the presence
of its elders assembled in rooms around the walls of
the same glittering apartment with the intention of
bestowing distinction upon what was known as &#8220;the
hop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sometimes, in dull seasons, there was a scarcity of
partners upon such occasions; but this year such was not
the case. Aside from the brothers of the belles and beauties
before referred to, who mustered in full force, there
was a reserved corps of cavaliers who, though past the
early and crude bloom of their first youth, were still malleable
material. Who could desire a more gallant attendant
than the agile though elderly Major Beaufort, who,
with a large party of nieces, daughters, and granddaughters,
made the tour of the watering-places each succeeding
year, pervading the atmosphere of each with the subtle
essence of his gallantry and hilariousness?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be a miserable man, sir,&#8221; proclaimed the
Major, chivalrously upon each succeeding Thursday&mdash;&#8220;I
should be a miserable man in seeing before me such grace
and youth and beauty, feeling that I am no longer young,
if I did not possess a heart which will throb for Woman as
long as it beats with life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Having distinguished himself by which poetic remark,
he usually called up a waiter with champagne and glasses,
in which beverage he gallantly drank the health of the
admiring circle which partook of it with him.
</p>
<p>Attached to the Beaufort party were various lesser luminaries,
each of whom, it must be confessed, might well,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
under ordinary circumstances, have formed the centre of
a circle himself; legal luminaries, social luminaries, political
luminaries, each playing ten-pins and whist, each
riding, each showing in all small gallantries, and adding
by their presence to the exhilaration of the hour.
</p>
<p>There was one gentleman, however, who, though he was
not of the Beaufort party, could still not be considered
among the lesser luminaries. He was a planet with an
orbit of his own. This gentleman had ridden up to the
hotel one afternoon on a fine horse, accompanied by a
handsome, gloomy boy on another animal as fine, and followed
by a well-dressed young negro carrying various
necessary trappings, and himself mounted in a manner
which did no discredit to his owner. The air of the party
was such as to occasion some sensation on the front gallery,
where the greater number of the guests were congregated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried one of the Beauforts, &#8220;what a distinguished-looking
man. Oh, what a handsome boy! and
what splendid horses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that moment one of the other ladies&mdash;a dark, quiet,
clever matron from South Carolina&mdash;uttered an exclamation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is Colonel De Willoughby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The new arrival recognised her at once and made his
way towards her with the most graceful air of ease and
pleasure, notwithstanding that it was necessary that he
should wind his way dexterously round numerous groups
in and out among a dozen chairs.
</p>
<p>He was a strikingly handsome man, dark, aquiline, tall
and lithe of figure; his clothes fitted him marvellously
well at the waist, his slender arched foot was incased in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
marvel of a boot, his black hair was rather long, and his
superb eyes gained a mysterious depth and mellowness
from the length and darkness of their lashes; altogether,
it was quite natural that for the moment the Beauforts
and their satellites should pale somewhat by comparison.
</p>
<p>When he bowed over Mrs. Marvin&#8217;s hand, a thrill of
pleasure made itself manifest in those surrounding them.
He spoke in the most melodious of voices.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest of pleasures,&#8221; he was heard to say. &#8220;I
did not expect this.&#8221; And then, in response to some question:
&#8220;My health since&mdash;since my loss has been very
poor. I hope to recover strength and spirits,&#8221; with an air
of delicate and gentle melancholy. &#8220;May I present my
boy&mdash;Rupert?&#8221;
</p>
<p>In response to the summons the boy came forward&mdash;not
awkwardly, or with any embarrassment, but with a bearing
not at all likely to create a pleasant impression. The
guests could see that he was even a handsomer boy than
he had seemed at a greater distance. He was very like
his father in the matter of aquiline features, clear pale-olive
skin and superb dark eyes: his face had even a fineness
the older man&#8217;s lacked, but the straight marks of a
fixed frown were upon his forehead, and his mouth wore a
look which accorded well with the lines.
</p>
<p>He approached and bared his head, making his boyish
bow in a manner which did credit to his training, but
though he blushed slightly on being addressed, his manner
was by no means a responsive one, and he moved away as
soon as an opportunity presented itself, leaving his father
making himself very fascinating in a gently chivalric way,
and establishing himself as a planet by the mere manner of
his address towards a woman who was neither pretty, young,
nor enthusiastic.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>There was no woman in the hotel so little prone to enthusiasm
as this one. She was old enough and clever
enough to have few illusions. It was thought singular
that though she admitted she had known the Colonel from
his youth, she showed very little partiality for his society,
and, indeed, treated him with marked reserve. She never
joined in the choruses of praise which were chanted daily
around her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the De Willoughbys very well,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Oh, yes, very well indeed&mdash;in a way. We hear a good
deal of them. De Courcy&#8217;s wife was a friend of mine.
This one is De Courcy, the other is Romaine, and there
was one who was considered a sort of black sheep and broke
with the family altogether. They don&#8217;t know where he is
and don&#8217;t care to know, I suppose. They have their own
views of the matter. Oh, yes; I know them very well, in
a way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When questioned by enthusiasts, she was obliged to confess
that the hero of the hour was bountifully supplied
with all outward gifts of nature, was to be envied his
charm of manner and the air of romance surrounding him,
though, in admitting this, she added a little comment not
generally approved of.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little of the Troubadour order,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but
I dare say no woman would deny that it is rather taking.
I don&#8217;t deny it, it is taking&mdash;if you don&#8217;t go below the surface.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Never was a man so popular as the Colonel, and never a
man so missed as he on the days of his indisposition. He
had such days when he did not leave his room and his
negro was kept busy attending to his wants. The nature
of his attacks was not definitely understood, but after
them he always appeared wearing an interesting air of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
languor and melancholy, and was more admired than
ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy seems to feel it very much,&#8221; the lady remarked.
&#8220;He always looks so uneasy and anxious, and never goes
away from the house at all. I suppose they are very fond
of each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say he does feel it very much,&#8221; said Mrs. Marvin
with her reserved little smile. &#8220;He is De Willoughby
enough for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not agreed to that he inherited his father&#8217;s grace
of manner however. He was a definitely unamiable boy,
if one might judge from appearances. He always wore a
dark little scowl, as if he were either on the point of falling
into a secret rage or making his way out of one; instead
of allowing himself to be admired and made a pet of,
he showed an unnatural preference for prowling around
the grounds and galleries alone, sometimes sitting in corners
and professing to read, but generally appearing to be
meditating resentfully upon his wrongs in a manner which
in a less handsome boy would have been decidedly unpleasant.
Even Mrs. Marvin&#8217;s advances did not meet with
any show of cordiality, though it was allowed that he appeared
less averse to her society than to that of any other
woman, including the half dozen belles and beauties who
would have enjoyed his boyish admiration greatly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew your mother,&#8221; said Mrs. Marvin to him one
day as he sat near her upon the gallery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; he answered, in a rather encouraging way.
&#8220;When did you know her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When she was young. We were girls together. She
was a beauty and I wasn&#8217;t, but we were very fond of each
other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gave his closed book a sullen look.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What makes women break so?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see why they break so. She had pretty eyes when she
died, but,&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew his handsome black brows down and scowled;
and, seeing that he was angry at himself for having spoken,
Mrs. Marvin made another remark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You miss her very much?&#8221; she said, gravely.
</p>
<p>He turned his face away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s better off where she is, I suppose,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what they always say of dead people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then still frowning he got up and walked away.
</p>
<p>The negro servants about the hotel were all fond of him,
though his manner towards them was that of a fiery and
enthusiastic young potentate, brooking no delay or interference.
His beauty and his high-handed way impressed
them as being the belongings of one favoured by fortune
and worthy of admiration and respect.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a D&#8217;Willoughby out and out,&#8221; said his father&#8217;s
negro, Tip. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t no mistake &#8217;bout dat. He&#8217;s a young
devil when his spirit&#8217;s up, &#8217;n it&#8217;s easy raised. But he&#8217;s a
powerful gen&#8217;lman sort o&#8217; boy&mdash;powerful. Throw&#8217;s you a
quarter soon&#8217;s look at ye, &#8217;n he&#8217;s got the right kind o&#8217; high
ways&mdash;dough der ain&#8217;t no sayin&#8217; he ain&#8217;t a young devil;
de Kurnel hisself cayn&#8217;t outcuss him when his spirit&#8217;s
up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Colonel and his son had been at the springs a
month, when the fancy-dress ball took place which was
the occasion of a very unpleasant episode in the annals of
this summer.
</p>
<p>For several days before the greatest excitement had
prevailed at the hotel. A pleasant air of mystery had prevailed
over the preparations that were being made. The
rural proprietors of the two stores in which the neighbourhood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
rejoiced were driven to distraction by constant
demands made upon them for articles and materials of
which they had never before heard, and which were not
procurable within a hundred miles of the place. Bedrooms
were overflowing with dresses in process of alteration
from ordinary social aspects to marvellous combinations
of imagination and ingenuity, while an amiable
borrowing and exchanging went on through all the corridors.
</p>
<p>On the day before the ball the Colonel&#8217;s popularity
reached its height. As it was the time of a certain local
election, there was held upon the grounds a political
meeting, giving such individuals as chose to avail themselves
of it the opportunity of expressing their opinions to
the assembled guests and the thirty or forty mountaineers
who had suddenly and without any warning of previous
existence appeared upon the scene.
</p>
<p>The Colonel had been one of the first called upon, and,
to the delight of his admirers, he responded at once with
the utmost grace to the call.
</p>
<p>When he ascended the little platform with the slow,
light step which was numbered among his chief attractions
and stood before his audience for a moment looking
down at them gently and reflectively from under his beautiful
lashes, a throb of expectation was felt in every tender
bosom.
</p>
<p>His speech fell short of no desire, being decided to be
simple perfection. His soft voice, his quiet ease of movement,
his eloquence, were all that could be hoped for from
mortal man. He mentioned with high-bred depreciation
the fact that he could not fairly call himself a politician
unless as any son of the fair South must be one at least at
heart, however devoid of the gifts which have made her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
greatest heard from continent to continent. He was only
one of the many who had at stake their cherished institutions,
the homes they loved, the beloved who brightened
those homes, and their own happiness as it was centred in
those homes, and irrevocably bound in that of the fairest
land upon which the fair sun shone.
</p>
<p>The applause at this juncture was so great as to oblige
him to pause for a few moments; but it was to be regretted
that nine out of ten of the mountaineers remained
entirely unresponsive, crossing their jean-covered
legs and rubbing their lean and grizzled jaws in a soulless
manner. They displayed this apathetic indifference to the
most graceful flight of rhetoric, to the most musical appeals
to the hearts of all men loving freedom, to the
announcement that matters had reached a sad and significant
crisis, that the peculiar institutions left as a legacy
by their forefathers were threatened by the Northern
fanatics, and that in the near future the blood of patriots
might be poured forth as a libation upon the soil they loved;
to eloquent denunciations of the hirelings and would-be
violators of our rights under the constitution. To all these
they listened, evidently devoting all their slow energies to
the comprehension of it, but they were less moved than
might have been expected of men little used to oratory.
</p>
<p>But it was the termination of the speech that stirred all
hearts. With a dexterity only to be compared to its easy
grace, the orator left the sterner side of the question for a
tenderer one to which he had already referred in passing,
and which was the side of all political questions which presented
themselves to such men as he. Every man, it was to be
hoped, knew the meaning of home and love and tenderness
in some form, however poor and humble and unpatriotic;
to every man was given a man&#8217;s privilege of defending the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
rights and sacredness of this home, this love, with his
strength, with his might, with the blood of his beating
heart if need be. To a Southern man, as to all men, his
right to be first in his own land in ruling, in choosing
rulers, in carrying out the laws, meant his right to defend
this home and that which was precious to him within it.
There were a few before him upon this summer&#8217;s day, alas,
alas! that Fate should will it so, who had not somewhere
a grave whose grass moved in the softness of the wind over
dead loves and hopes cherished even in this hour as naught
else was cherished. &#8220;And these graves&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He faltered and paused, glancing towards the doorway
with a singular expression. For a few seconds he could
not go on. He was obliged to raise to his lips the glass of
water which had been provided for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; was sighed softly through the room, &#8220;his emotion
has overpowered him. Poor fellow! how sad he
looks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Marvin simply followed the direction his eyes had
taken. She was a practical person. The object her eye
met was the figure of the boy who had come in a few minutes
before. He was leaning against the doorpost, attired in a
cool suit of white linen, his hands in his pockets, the expression
of his handsome darkling young face a most curious
one. He was staring at his father steadily, his fine
eyes wide open holding a spark of inward rage, his nostrils
dilated and quivering. He seemed bent upon making the
orator meet his glance, but the orator showed no desire to
do so. He gave his sole attention to his glass of water.
To this clever, elderly Southern matron it was an interesting
scene.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he sprang up in two minutes and threw something
deadly and murderous at him,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
should not be in the least surprised; and I should not be
the first to blame him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the rest of the audience was intent upon the Colonel,
who, recovering himself, finished his harangue with
an appeal that the land made sacred by those loves, those
homes, those graves, might be left solely in the hands of
the men who loved it best, who knew its needs, who yearned
for its highest development, and who, when the needful
hour arrived, would lay down their lives to save its honour.
</p>
<p>When he concluded, and was on the point of seating himself
very quietly, without any appearance of being conscious
of the great sensation he had created, and still wearing an
admirable touch of melancholy upon his fine countenance,
Major Beaufort rushed towards him, almost upsetting a
chair in his eagerness, and grasped his hand and shook it
with a congratulatory ardour so impressive and enthusiastic
as to be a sensation in itself.
</p>
<p>There were other speeches afterwards. Fired by the example
of his friend, Major Beaufort distinguished himself
by an harangue overflowing with gallantry and adorned
throughout with amiable allusions to the greatest power of
all, the power of Youth, Beauty, and Womanhood. The
political perspicuity of the address was perhaps somewhat
obscured by its being chivalrously pointed towards those fair
beings who brighten our existence and lengthen our griefs.
Without the Ladies, the speaker found, we may be politicians,
but we cannot be gentlemen. He discovered (upon
the spot, and with a delicate suggestion of pathos) that by
a curious coincidence, the Ladies were the men&#8217;s mothers,
their wives, their sisters, their daughters. This being
greatly applauded, he added that over these husbands, these
fathers, these brothers&mdash;and might be added &#8220;these lovers&#8221;&mdash;the
Ladies wielded a mighty influence. The position of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
Woman, even in the darkest ages, had been the position
of one whose delicate hand worked the lever of the world;
but to-day, in these more enlightened times, in the age of
advancement and discovery, before what great and sublime
power did the nobleman, the inventor, the literary man,
the warrior, bow, as he bowed before the shrine of the
Ladies?
</p>
<p>But it was the Colonel who bore away the palm and was
the hero of the hour. When the audience rose he was
surrounded at once by groups of enthusiasts, who shook
hands with him, who poured forth libations of praise,
who hung upon his every word with rapture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How proud of you he must be,&#8221; said one of the fairest
in the group of worshippers; &#8220;boys of his age feel
things so strongly. I wonder why he doesn&#8217;t come forward
and say something to you? He is too shy, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say,&#8221; said the Colonel with his most fascinating
gentle smile. &#8220;One must not expect enthusiasm of boys.
I have no doubt he thought it a great bore and wondered
what I was aiming at.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; exclaimed the fair enslaver. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do
him an injustice, Colonel de Willoughby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But as she glanced towards the doorway her voice died
down and the expression of her face changed somewhat.
The boy&mdash;still with his hands in his pockets&mdash;was looking
on with an air which was as insolent as it was remarkable,
an air of youthful scorn and malignant derision which
staggered even the enthusiast.
</p>
<p>She turned uneasily to the Colonel, who faintly smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a handsome fellow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I must own
to being a vain parent, but he has a demon of a temper
and he has been spoiled. He&#8217;ll get over it when he is
older.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>It was a great blow to his admirers when it became
known the next morning that the Colonel was suffering
from one of his attacks, and even a worse one than usual.
Neb was shut up in his room with him all day, and it was
rumoured that the boy would not come down, but wandered
up and down the corridors restlessly, looking miserable
enough to have touched the stoniest heart.
</p>
<p>During the morning quite a gloom pervaded the atmosphere;
only the excitement of preparations for the
evening could have proved an antidote to the general depression.
</p>
<p>It was to be a brilliant occasion. The county had been
scoured for guests, some of whom were to travel in their
carriages from other watering-places for twenty or thirty
miles. The ballroom had been decorated by a committee
of ladies; the costumes, it was anticipated, would be dazzling
beyond measure. No disappointment was felt when
the festal hour arrived, but the very keen emotion attendant
upon the absence of the interesting invalid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he had only been well enough to be here,&#8221; it was
said, &#8220;how he would have enjoyed it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Major Beaufort, attired as a Sultan and appropriately
surrounded by his harem in sarsenet trousers and spangled
veils, gave universal satisfaction. Minnehaha in feathers
and moccasins, and Hiawatha in moccasins and feathers,
gave a touch of mild poetry to the evening. Sisters of
Charity in white cambric caps told their beads through
the mazes of the lancers. Night and Morning, attired
respectively in black and white tarletan, and both profusely
adorned with silver paper stars, combined their
forces to add romance and vividness to the festive scene.
</p>
<p>There had been dancing and flirtation, upon which those
of the guests who did not join gazed for an hour or so as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
they sat in the chairs arranged around the walls, doubtless
enjoying themselves intensely, and the gaiety was at its
height, when some commotion became manifest at one of
the doors. Those grouped about it appeared to be startled
at finding something or somebody behind them, and
almost immediately it was seen that this something or
somebody was bent upon crowding past them. A loud,
insane-sounding laugh was heard. The dancers stopped
and turned towards it with one accord, their alarm and
astonishment depicted on their faces. The spectators
bent forward in their seats.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; was the general exclamation. &#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This last interjection took the form of a chorus as two
of the group at the doorway were pushed headlong into
the room, and a tall, unsteady, half-dressed figure made its
violent entrance.
</p>
<p>At the first glance it was not easy to recognize it; it was
simply the figure of a very tall man in an ungirt costume,
composed of shirt and pantaloons. He was crushed and
dishevelled. His hair hung over his forehead. He strode
into the middle of the quadrille, and stood with his hands
in his pockets, swaying to and fro, with a stare at once
malicious and vacant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he remarked, sardonically, as he took in his surroundings,
and then everyone recognized at once that it
was Colonel De Willoughby, and that Colonel De Willoughby
was mad drunk.
</p>
<p>He caught sight of Major Beaufort, and staggered
towards him with another frantic laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God, Major,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;how becomin&#8217; &#8217;tis, how
damned becomin&#8217;. Harem an&#8217; all. Only trouble is you&#8217;re
too fat&mdash;too fat; if you weren&#8217;t so fat wouldn&#8217;t look such
a damned fool.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>It was to be regretted there was no longer an air of refinement
about his intoxication, no suggestion of melancholy
grace, no ghost of his usual high-bred suavity; with his
laugh and stare and unsteady legs he was simply a more
drunken lunatic than one generally sees.
</p>
<p>There was a rush at him from all sides&mdash;Major Beaufort,
in his Turkish trousers, being the first to fall upon him
and have his turban stamped upon in the encounter. He
was borne across the room, shouting and struggling and
indulging in profanity of the most frightful kind. Just
as they got him to the door his black boy Neb appeared,
looking ashen with fright.
</p>
<p>&#8220;De Lord o&#8217; massey,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t lef&#8217; him
more&#8217;n a minit. He sent me down hisself. One o&#8217; his
cunnin&#8217; ways to get rid o&#8217; me when he&#8217;s at de wust. Opium
&#8217;n whiskey, dats what gets him dis way. Bof togedder
a-gwine ter kill him some dese days, &#8217;n de opium am de
wustest. For de Lord&#8217;s sake some o&#8217; you gen&#8217;men cum &#8217;n
hep me till I git him quieted down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was all over in a few moments, but the effort made
to return to hilariousness was a failure; the shock to the
majority of the gay throng had been great. Mrs. Marvin,
sitting in her special corner, was besieged with questions,
and at length was prevailed upon through the force of
circumstances to speak the truth as she knew it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he ever done it before?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Yes, he has
done it before&mdash;he has done it a dozen times since he has
been here, only to-night he was madder than usual and got
away from his servant. What is it? It is opium when it
isn&#8217;t whiskey, and whiskey when it isn&#8217;t opium, and
oftenest it is both together. He is the worst of a bad lot,
and if you haven&#8217;t understood that miserable angry boy
before you may understand him now. His mother died
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
of a broken heart when he was twelve years old, and he
watched her die of it and knew what killed her, and is
proud enough to feel the shame that rests upon him.
That&#8217;s as much as I care to say, and yet it isn&#8217;t the half.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When those bearing the Colonel to his room turned into
the corridor leading to it they encountered his son, who
met them with a white-lipped rage, startling to every man
of them in its incongruous contrast to the boyish face and
figure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; he said, panting. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got him, have
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; responded the Colonel hilariously; &#8220;&#8217;ve got me
safe &#8217;nuff; pick me up ad&#8217; car&#8217; me. If man won&#8217;t go out,
tote &#8217;m out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They carried him into his rooms and laid him down, and
more than one among them turned curiously to the boy as
he stood near the bed looking down at the dishevelled,
incoherent, gibbering object upon it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn him,&#8221; he said in a sudden outburst; &#8220;damn
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, youngster,&#8221; said one of the party, &#8220;that&#8217;s not
the thing exactly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to the devil,&#8221; roared the lad, livid with wrath and
shame. &#8220;Do you think I&#8217;ll not say what I please? A
nice one he is for a fellow to have for a father&mdash;to be tied
to and dragged about by&mdash;drinking himself mad and disgracing
himself after his palaver and sentiment and playing
the gentleman. He ought to be a gentleman&mdash;he&#8217;s got
a gentleman&#8217;s name, and&#8221;&mdash;choking a little&mdash;&#8220;all the rest
of it. I hate him! He makes me sick. I wish he was
dead. He&#8217;s a liar and a bully and a fool. I&#8217;d kill him if
he wasn&#8217;t my father. I should like to kill him for <i>being</i>
my father!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>Suddenly his voice faltered and his face turned white.
He walked to the other side of the room, turning his back
to them all, and, flinging himself into a chair, dropped his
curly head on his arm on the window-sill and sobbed aloud
with a weakness and broken-down fury pitiful to see.
</p>
<p>The Colonel burst into a frantic shriek of laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer little devil,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Prou&#8217; lit&#8217;l devil! Like&#8217;s
moth&#8216;&mdash;don&#8217; like it. Moth&#8217; used er cry. <i>She</i> didn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p>As the Cross-roads had regarded Tom as a piece of
personal property to be proud of, so it fell into the habit
of regarding his <i>protégée</i>. The romance of her history
was considered to confer distinction upon the vicinity, and
Tom&#8217;s affection for her was approved of as a sentiment
worthy of the largeness of the Cross-roads nature.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They kinder set one anuther off,&#8221; it was frequently
remarked, &#8220;her a-bein&#8217; so little and him so big, an&#8217; both
of &#8217;em stickin&#8217; to each other so clost. Lordy! &#8217;tain&#8217;t no
use a-tryin&#8217; to part &#8217;em. Sheby, she ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; nowhar
&#8217;thout Tom, an&#8217; Tom, he h&#8217;aint a-goin&#8217; nowhars &#8217;thout
Sheby!&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the child was five years old the changes which
had taken place in the store were followed by still greater
changes in the house. Up to her fifth birthday the experiences
had balanced themselves between the store and
the three back rooms with their bare floors and rough
walls. She had had her corner, her small chair behind
the counter or near the stove, and there she had amused
herself with her playthings through long or short days,
and in the evening Tom had taken her upon his shoulder
and carried her back to the house, as it was called, leaving
his careless, roystering gaiety behind him locked up in
the store, ready to be resumed for the edification of his
customers the next morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t hev no pore folkses ways wid dat chile,&#8221; said
Mornin once to Mrs. Doty; &#8220;he don&#8217;t never speak to her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
no other then gen&#8217;leman way. He&#8217;s a-raisin&#8217; her to be
fitten fur de highes&#8217;. He&#8217;s mighty keerful ob her way ob
speakin&#8217; an&#8217; settin&#8217; to de table. Mornin&#8217;s got to stand
&#8217;hind her cheer an&#8217; wait on her hersel&#8217;; an&#8217; sence she was
big &#8217;nuff to set dar, she&#8217;s had a silver fork an&#8217; spoon
an&#8217; napkin-ring same&#8217;s de President himself. Ah; he&#8217;s
a-raisin&#8217; her keerful, is Mars D&#8217;Willerby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Waal,&#8221; said Mrs. Doty, &#8220;ef &#8217;twarn&#8217;t Tom D&#8217;Willerby,
I shed say it was a puttin&#8217; on airs; but thar ain&#8217;t no airs
&#8217;bout Tom D&#8217;Willerby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From the first Mr. Stamps&#8217;s interest in Tom&#8217;s <i>protégée</i>
had been unfailing though quiet. When he came into
the store, which he did some three times a week, it was
his habit to fix his small, pale eyes upon her and follow
her movements stealthily but with unflagging watchfulness.
Occasionally this occupation so absorbed him that
when she moved to her small corner behind the counter,
vaguely oppressed by his surveillance, he sauntered across
the room and took his seat upon the counter itself, persisting
in his mild, furtive gaze, until it became too much
for her and she sought refuge at Tom&#8217;s knee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks at me,&#8221; she burst out distressedly on one
such day. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him look at me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom gave a start and turned round, and Mr. Stamps
gave a start also, at once mildly recovering himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave her alone,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;what are you lookin&#8217;
at her for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s no law agin it, Tom,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;An&#8217; she&#8217;s
wuth a lookin&#8217; at. She&#8217;s that kind, an&#8217; it&#8217;ll grow on her.
Ten year from now thar ain&#8217;t no law es &#8217;ed keep &#8217;em
from lookin&#8217; at her, &#8217;thout it was made an&#8217; passed in Congrist.
She&#8217;ll hev to git reckonciled to a-bein&#8217; looked at.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Leave her alone,&#8221; repeated Tom, quite fiercely. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
not have her troubled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t go to trouble her, Tom,&#8221; said Mr. Stamps,
softly; and he slipped down from the counter and sidled
out of the store and went home.
</p>
<p>With Mr. Stamps Sheba always connected her first
knowledge of the fact that her protector&#8217;s temper could
be disturbed. She had never seen him angry until she
saw Mr. Stamps rouse him to wrath on the eventful fifth
birthday, from which the first exciting events of her life
dated themselves. Up to that time she had seen only in
his great strength and broad build a power to protect and
shield her own fragility and smallness from harm or fear.
When he took her in his huge arms and held her at what
seemed to be an incredible height from the ordinary platform
of existence, she had only felt the cautious tenderness
of his touch and recognised her own safety, and it
had never occurred to her that his tremendous voice,
which was so strong and deep by nature, that it might
have been a terrible one if he had chosen to make it so,
could express any other feeling than kindliness in its
cheery roar.
</p>
<p>But on this fifth birthday Tom presented himself to her
childish mind in a new light.
</p>
<p>She had awakened early to find him standing at her
small bedside and a new doll lying in her arms. It was a
bigger doll than she had ever owned before, and so gaily
dressed, that in her first rapture her breath quite forsook
her. When she recovered it, she scrambled up, holding
her new possession in one arm and clung with the other
around Tom&#8217;s neck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the lovely, lovely doll!&#8221; she cried, and then hid
her face on his shoulder.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hallo,&#8221; said Tom, hugging her, &#8220;what is she hiding
her eyes for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She nestled closer to him with a little sob of loving delight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;because of the doll,&#8221; she answered, bewildered
by her own little demonstration and yet perfect
in her confidence that he would understand her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom, cheerfully, &#8220;that&#8217;s a queer thing,
ain&#8217;t it? Look here, did you know it was your birthday?
Five years old to-day&mdash;think of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat down and settled her in her usual place on his
knee, her doll in her arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;of her setting up a birthday on
purpose to be five years old and have a doll given her.
That&#8217;s a nice business, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>After they had breakfasted together in state, the doll
was carried into the store to be played with there. It was
a wet day, and, the air being chilled by a heavy mountain
rain, a small fire was burning in the stove, and by this fire
the two settled themselves to enjoy the morning together,
the weather precluding the possibility of their being disturbed
by many customers. But in the height of their
quiet enjoyment they were broken in upon by the sound
of horse&#8217;s hoofs splashing in the mud outside and Mr.
Stamps&#8217;s hat appeared above the window-sill.
</p>
<p>It was Sheba who saw it first, and in the strength of her
desire to avoid the wearer, she formed a desperate plan.
She rose so quietly that Tom, who was reading a paper,
did not hear her, and, having risen, drew her small chair
behind the counter in the hope that, finding her place
vacant, the visitor would not suspect her presence.
</p>
<p>In this she was not disappointed. Having brushed the
mud from his feet on the porch, Mr. Stamps appeared at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
the doorway, and, after his usual precautionary glance
about him, made his way to the stove. His manner was at
once propitiatory and friendly. He drew up a chair and
put his wet feet on the stove, where they kept up a comfortable
hissing sound as they dried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, Tom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;howdy?&#8221; And from her
hiding-place Sheba saw him rubbing his legs from the
knee downwards as he said it, with an air of solid enjoyment
which suggested that he was congratulating himself
upon something he had in his mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Morning,&#8221; responded Tom.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps rubbed his legs again quite luxuriously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a lookin&#8217; well, Tom,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Lord,
yes, ye&#8217;re a lookin&#8217; powerful well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom laid his paper down and folded it on his knee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lookin&#8217; well, am I?&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a
delicate weakly sort of fellow in general, I am, and it&#8217;s
encouraging to hear that I&#8217;m looking well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps laughed rather spasmodically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be agin bein&#8217; the same kind o&#8217; weakly myself,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;nor the same kind o&#8217; delycate. You&#8217;re a
powerfle hansum man, Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Tom, drily, &#8220;I&#8217;m a handsome man.
That&#8217;s what carried me along this far. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve always
had to rely on&mdash;that and a knock-down intellect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps rubbed his legs with his air of luxury again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Folks is fond o&#8217; sayin&#8217; beauty ain&#8217;t but skin deep,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;but I wouldn&#8217;t hev it no deeper myself&mdash;bein&#8217; so
that it kivers. An&#8217;, talkin&#8217; o&#8217; beauty, she&#8217;s one&mdash;Lord,
yes. She&#8217;s one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;leave her alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t a gwine to harm her, Tom,&#8221; replied Mr.
Stamps, &#8220;&#8217;tain&#8217;t a gwine to harm her none. What made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
me think of it was it a bein&#8217; jest five years since she was
born&mdash;a makin&#8217; it her birthday an&#8217; her jest five years old.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; cried Tom, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been counting it up,
have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Mr. Stamps, with true modesty of demeanour,
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t ben a countin&#8217; of it up, Tom.&#8221; And
he drew a dirty memorandum book softly from his pocket.
&#8220;I set it down at the time es it happened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laid the dirty book on his knee and turned over its
pages carefully as if looking for some note.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t much on readin&#8217; an&#8217; writin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217;
&#8217;rithmetick it goes kinder hard with me now an&#8217; agin, but
a man&#8217;s got to know suthin&#8217; on &#8217;em if he &#8217;lows to keep
anyways even. I &#8217;low to keep even, sorter, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve give a
good deal o&#8217; time to steddyin&#8217; of &#8217;em. I never went to no
school, but I&#8217;ve sot things down es I want to remember,
an&#8217; I kin count out money. I never was imposed on none
I rekin, an&#8217; I never lost nothin&#8217;. Yere&#8217;s whar I sot it
down about her a-bein&#8217; born an&#8217; the woman a-dyin&#8217; an&#8217; him
a-gwine away. Ye cayn&#8217;t read it, mebbe.&#8221; He bent forward,
pointing to the open page and looking up at Tom as
if he expected him to be interested. &#8220;Thar it is,&#8221; he
added in his thin, piping, little voice, &#8220;even to the time
o&#8217; day. Mornin, she told me that. &#8217;Bout three o&#8217;clock in
the mornin&#8217; in thet thar little front room. Ef anyone shed
ever want to know particular, thar it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The look in Tom&#8217;s face was far from being a calm one.
He fidgetted in his chair and finally rolled his paper into a
hard wad and threw it at the counter as if it had been a
missile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;take my advice and let that
alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps regarded his dirty book affectionately.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t a-gwine to hurt nothin&#8217; to hev it down,&#8221; he
replied, with an air of simplicity.
</p>
<p>He shut it up, returned it to his pocket, and clasped his
hands about his knees, while he fixed his eyes on the
glimmer of red showing itself through a crack in a stove-plate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kinder curi&#8217;s I should hev happened along by thar
this mornin&#8217;,&#8221; he remarked, reflectively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By where?&#8221; demanded Tom.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps hugged his knees as if he enjoyed their companionship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By thar,&#8221; he responded, cheerfully, &#8220;the Holler, Tom.
An&#8217; it &#8217;peared to me it &#8217;ed be kinder int&#8217;restin&#8217; to take a
look through, bein&#8217; as this was the day as the thing kinder
started. So I hitched my mule an&#8217; went in.&#8221; He paused
a moment as if to enjoy his knees again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps looked up at him harmlessly. &#8220;Eh?&#8221; he
enquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said &#8216;well,&#8217;&#8221; answered Tom, &#8220;that&#8217;s what I said.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; replied Mr. Stamps. &#8220;Waal, thar wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
thar, Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For the moment Tom&#8217;s expression was one of relief.
But he said nothing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; thar,&#8221; Mr. Stamps continued.
Then occurred another pause. &#8220;Nothin&#8217;,&#8221; he added after
it, &#8220;nothin&#8217; particular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tenderness with which he embraced his knees at this
juncture had something like fascination in it.
</p>
<p>Tom found himself fixing a serious gaze upon his clasping
arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I kinder looked round,&#8221; he proceeded, &#8220;an&#8217; if there&#8217;d
ben anythin&#8217; thar I &#8217;low I&#8217;d hev seed it. But thar wasn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
nothin&#8217;, nothin&#8217; but the empty rooms an&#8217; a dead leaf or so
es hed blowed in through a broken winder, an&#8217; the pile o&#8217;
ashes in the fireplace beat down with the rain as hed
fell down the chimney. Mighty lonesome an&#8217; still them
ashes looked; an&#8217; thar wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but them an&#8217; the
leaves,&mdash;&mdash;an&#8217; a bit of a&#8217; envelope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom moved his chair back. Sheba thought he was
going to get up suddenly. But he remained seated,
perhaps because Mr. Stamps began again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but them an&#8217; the bit of a&#8217;
envelope,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;It was a-sticken in a crack o&#8217;
the house, low down, like it hed ben swep&#8217; or blowed thar
an&#8217; overlooked. I shouldn&#8217;t hev seed it&#8221;&mdash;modestly&mdash;&#8220;ef
I hedn&#8217;t ben a-goin&#8217; round on my hands an&#8217; knees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Tom rose very suddenly indeed, so suddenly that
he knocked his chair over and amazed Sheba by kicking it
violently across the store. For the moment he so far forgot
himself as to be possessed with some idea of falling upon
Mr. Stamps with the intent to do him bodily injury. He
seized him by the shoulders and turned him about so that
he had an excellent view of his unprepossessing back.
What Mr. Stamps thought it would have been difficult to
discover. Sheba fancied that when he opened his mouth
he was going to utter a cry of terror. But he did not.
He turned his neck about as well as he could under the
circumstances, and looking up into Tom&#8217;s face meekly
smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;ye ain&#8217;t a-gwine ter do a thing to me,
not a dern thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; cried Tom, furiously, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
kick&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef ye was jest haaf to let drive at me, ye&#8217;d break my
neck,&#8221; said Mr. Stamps, &#8220;an ye ain&#8217;t a-gwine ter do it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
Ef ye was, Tom, ye&#8217;d be a bigger fool than I took ye fer.
Lemme go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked so diminutive and weak-eyed, as he made
these remarks, that it was no wonder Tom released him
helplessly, though he was obliged to thrust his hands deep
into his pockets and keep them under control.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d given you one lesson,&#8221; he burst forth;
&#8220;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps interrupted him, continuing to argue his
side of the question, evidently feeling it well worth his
while to dispose of it on the spot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye weigh three hundred, Tom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;ef ye weigh
a pound, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t weigh but ninety, &#8217;n ye couldn&#8217;t handle
me keerful enuf not to leave me in a fix as wouldn&#8217;t be no
credit to ye when ye was done; &#8217;n it &#8217;ed look kinder bad
for ye to meddle with me, anyhow. An&#8217; the madder ye
get, the more particular ye&#8217;ll be not to. Thar&#8217;s whar ye
are, Tom; an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t sich a fool as not to know it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His perfect confidence in the strength of his position,
and in Tom&#8217;s helplessness against it, was a thing to be
remembered. Tom remembered it long afterwards, though
at the moment it only roused him to greater heat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;let&#8217;s hear what you&#8217;re
driving at. What I want to know is what you&#8217;re driving
at. Let&#8217;s hear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps&#8217;s pale eyes fixed themselves with interest on
his angry face. He had seated himself in his chair again,
and he watched Tom closely as he rambled on in his simple,
uncomplaining way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re fond o&#8217; laughin&#8217; at me round yere at the store,
Tom,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t agin it. A man don&#8217;t
make nothin&#8217; much by bein&#8217; laughed at, I rekin, but he
don&#8217;t lose nothin&#8217; nuther, an&#8217; that&#8217;s what I <i>am</i> agin. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
rekin ye laugh &#8217;cos I kinder look like a fool&mdash;an&#8217; I hain&#8217;t
nothin&#8217; agin thet, nuther, Lord! not by a heap. A man
ain&#8217;t a-gwine to lose nothin&#8217; by lookin&#8217; like a fool. I hain&#8217;t
never, not a cent, Tom. But I ain&#8217;t es big a fool es I look,
an&#8217; I don&#8217;t &#8217;low ye air, uther. Thar&#8217;s whar I argy from.
Ye ain&#8217;t es big a fool as ye look, an&#8217; ye&#8217;d be in a bad fix ef
ye was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; ordered Tom, &#8220;and leave me out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cayn&#8217;t leave ye out, Tom,&#8221; said Mr. Stamps, &#8220;fer
ye&#8217;re in. Ye&#8217;d be as big a fool as ye look ef ye was doin&#8217;
all this yere fer nothin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All what?&#8221; demanded Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gals,&#8221; suggested Mr. Stamps, &#8220;is plenty. An&#8217; ef
ye take to raisin&#8217; &#8217;em as this un&#8217;s ben raised, ye ain&#8217;t
makin&#8217; much; an&#8217; ef thar ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to be made, Tom,
what&#8217;s yer aim?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He put it as if it was a conundrum without an answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s yer aim, Tom?&#8221; he repeated, pleasantly, &#8220;ef
thar ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to be made?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s honest face flamed into red which was almost
purple, the veins swelled on his forehead, his indignation
almost deprived him of his breath. He fell into a chair
with a concussion which shook the building.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good&mdash;good Lord!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;how I wish you
weighed five hundred pounds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It is quite certain that if Stamps had, he would have demolished
him utterly upon the spot, leaving him in such a
condition that his remains would hardly have been a source
of consolation to his friends. He pointed to the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to get out,&#8221; he said, &#8220;start. This is getting
the better of me&mdash;and if it does&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stamps rose.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ye wouldn&#8217;t do a dern thing, Tom,&#8221; he said, peaceably,
&#8220;not a dern thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sidled towards the door, and reaching it, paused to
reflect, shaking his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef thar ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to be made,&#8221; he said, &#8220;ye&#8217;v got
ter hev a aim, an&#8217; what is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Observing that Tom made a move in his chair, he slipped
through the doorway rather hurriedly. Sheba thought he
was gone, but a moment later the door re-opened and he
thrust his head in and spoke, not intrusively&mdash;simply as if
offering a suggestion which might prove of interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It begun with a &#8216;L,&#8217;&#8221; he said; &#8220;thar was a name on
it, and it begun with a &#8216;L&#8217;.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p>It was upon the evening after this interview with Mr.
Stamps that Tom broached to his young companion a
plan which had lain half developed in his mind for some
time.
</p>
<p>They had gone into the back room and eaten together
the supper Mornin had prepared with some extra elaboration
to do honour to the day, and then Sheba had played
with her doll Lucinda while Tom looked on, somewhat
neglecting his newspaper and pipe in his interest in her
small pretence of maternity.
</p>
<p>At last, when she had put Lucinda to sleep in the
wooden cradle which had been her own, he called her to
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to ask you a question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She came readily and stood at his knee, laying her
hands upon it and looking up at him, as she had had a
habit of doing ever since she first stood alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like some new rooms?&#8221; he said, suggestively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Like these?&#8221; she answered, a pretty wonder in her
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;not like these&mdash;bigger and brighter
and prettier. With flowers on the walls and flowers on the
carpets, and all the rest to match.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had mentioned this bold idea to Molly Hollister the
day before, and she had shown such pleasure in it, that he
had been quite elated.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that I need anything different,&#8221; he had said,
&#8220;but the roughness and bareness don&#8217;t seem to suit her.
I&#8217;ve thought it often when I&#8217;ve seen her running about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems like thar ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; you don&#8217;t think of, Tom,&#8221;
said Molly, admiringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;I think about her a good deal,
that&#8217;s a fact. She seems to have given me a kind of imagination.
I used to think I hadn&#8217;t any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had imagination enough to recognise at the present
moment in the child&#8217;s uplifted face some wistful thought
she did not know how to express, and he responded to it
by speaking again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be prettier rooms than these,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What
do you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her glance wandered across the hearth to where the cradle
stood in the corner with Lucinda in it. Then she looked
up at him again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prettier than this,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;with flowers. But
don&#8217;t take this away.&#8221; The feeling which stirred her
flushed her childish cheek and made her breath come and
go faster. She drew still nearer to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take this away,&#8221; she repeated, and laid her hand
on his.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Tom, giving her a curious look.
</p>
<p>She met the look helplessly. She could not have put
her vague thought into words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t take it away,&#8221; she said again, and suddenly
laid her face upon his great open palm.
</p>
<p>For a minute or two there was silence. Tom sat very
still and looked at the fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said at length, &#8220;we won&#8217;t take it away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a few days, however, it was well known for at least
fifteen miles around the Cross-roads that Tom D&#8217;Willerby
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
was going to build a new house, and that it was going to be
fitted up with great splendour with furniture purchased at
Brownsboro.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Store carpetin&#8217; on every floor an&#8217; paper on every wall,&#8221;
said Dave Hollister to Molly when he went home after
hearing the news. &#8220;An&#8217; Sheby&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; with him to
choose &#8217;em. He says he&#8217;ll bet fifty dollars she has her
notions about things, an&#8217; he&#8217;s a-goin to hev &#8217;em carried
out, fer it&#8217;s all fer her, an&#8217; she&#8217;s the one to be pleased.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not many weeks before the rooms were so near
completion that the journey to Brownsboro was made, and
it was upon this day of her first journeying out into the
world that Sheba met with her first adventure. She remembered
long afterwards the fresh brightness of the early
morning when she was lifted into the buggy which stood
before the door, while Mornin ran to and fro in the agreeable
bustle attendant upon forgetting important articles
and being reminded of them by shocks. When Tom
climbed into his seat and they drove away, the store-porch
seemed quite crowded with those who watched their triumphant
departure. Sheba looked back and saw Mornin
showing her teeth and panting for breath, while Molly
Hollister waved the last baby&#8217;s sunbonnet, holding its
denuded owner in her arms. The drive was a long one,
but the travellers enjoyed it from first to last. Tom found
his companion&#8217;s conversation quite sufficient entertainment
to while away the time, and when at intervals she refreshed
herself from Mornin&#8217;s basket and fell asleep, he enjoyed
driving along quietly while he held her small, peacefully
relaxed body on his knee, quite as much as another man
might have enjoyed a much more exciting occupation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an amount of comfort in it,&#8221; he said, reflectively,
as the horse plodded along on the shady side of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
road, &#8220;an amount of comfort that&#8217;s astonishing. I don&#8217;t
know, but I&#8217;d like to have her come to a standstill just
about now and never grow any older or bigger. But I
thought the same thing three years ago, that&#8217;s a fact.
And when she gets to blooming out and enjoying her
bits of girl finery there&#8217;ll be pleasure in that too, plenty
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She awakened from one of these light sleeps just as
they were entering Brownsboro, and her delight and awe
at the dimensions and business aspect of the place pleased
Tom greatly, and was the cause of his appearing a perfect
mine of reliable information on the subject of large towns
and the habits of persons residing in them.
</p>
<p>Brownsboro contained at least six or seven hundred
inhabitants, and, as Court was being held, there were a
good many horses to be seen tied to the hitching-posts;
groups of men were sitting before the stores and on the
sidewalks, while something which might almost have
been called a crowd was gathered before the Court-house
itself.
</p>
<p>Sheba turned her attention to the tavern they were
approaching with a view to spending the night, and her
first glance alighted upon an object of interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a big boy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He looks tired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was not such a very big boy, though he was perhaps
fourteen years old and tall of his age. He stood upon the
plank-walk which ran at the front of the house, and
leaned against the porch with his hands in his pockets.
He was a slender, lithe boy, well dressed in a suit of fine
white linen. He had a dark, spirited face, and long-lashed
dark eyes, but, notwithstanding these advantages,
he looked far from amiable as he stood lounging discontentedly
and knitting his brows in the sun.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>But Sheba admired him greatly and bent forward that
she might see him better, regarding him with deep interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a pretty boy,&#8221; she said, softly, &#8220;I&mdash;I like him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom scarcely heard her. He was looking at the boy
himself, and his face wore a troubled and bewildered expression.
His gaze was so steady that at length the object
of it felt its magnetic influence and lifted his eyes. That
his general air of discontent did not belie him, and that
he was by no means an amiable boy, was at once proved.
He did not bear the scrutiny patiently, his face darkened
still more, and he scowled without any pretence of concealing
the fact.
</p>
<p>Tom turned away uneasily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d be a handsome fellow if he hadn&#8217;t such an evil
look,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I must have seen him before; I wonder
who he is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were many strangers in the house, principally
attenders upon the Court being held. Court week was a
busy time for Brownsboro, which upon such occasions
assumed a bustling and festive air, securing its friends
from less important quarters, engaging in animated discussions
of the cases in hand, and exhibiting an astonishing
amount of legal knowledge, using the most mystical
terms in ordinary conversation, and secretly feeling its
importance a good deal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sparkses&#8221; was the name of the establishment at which
the travellers put up, and, being the better of the two
taverns in which the town rejoiced, Sparkses presented
indeed an enlivening spectacle. It was a large frame
house with the usual long verandah at the front, upon
which verandah there were always to be seen customers in
rocking-chairs, their boots upon the balustrade, their
hands clasped easily on the tops of their heads. During
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Court week these customers with their rocking-chairs and
boots seemed to multiply themselves indefinitely, and,
becoming exhilarated by the legal business transacted
around them, bestirred themselves to jocularity and argument,
thus adding to the liveliness of the occasion.
</p>
<p>At such periods Mr. Sparkes was a prominent feature.
Attired in an easy costume seemingly composed principally
of suspenders, and bearing a pipe in his hand, he
permeated the atmosphere with a business-like air which
had long stamped him in the minds of his rural guests as
a person of administrative abilities rarely equalled and
not at all to be surpassed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s everywhar on the place, is Sparkes,&#8221; had been
said of him. &#8220;He&#8217;s at dinner, &#8217;n supper, &#8217;n breakfast, &#8217;n
out on the porch, &#8217;n in the bar, an&#8217; kinder sashiatin&#8217; through
the whole thing. Thet thar tavern wouldn&#8217;t be nothin&#8217; ef
he wasn&#8217;t thar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not to be disputed that he appeared at dinner and
breakfast and supper, and that on each appearance he disposed
of a meal of such proportions as caused his countenance
to deepen in colour and assume a swelled aspect,
which was, no doubt, extremely desirable under the circumstances,
and very good for the business, though it could
scarcely be said to lighten the labour of Mrs. Sparkes and
her daughters, who apparently existed without any more
substantial sustenance than the pleasure of pouring out cups
of coffee and tea and glasses of milk, and cutting slices of
pie, of which they possibly partook through some process
of absorption.
</p>
<p>To the care of Mrs. Sparkes Tom confided his charge
when, a short time after their arrival, he made his first pilgrimage
for business purposes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been on the road all day,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I won&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
take her out till to-morrow; so if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll leave
her with you until I come back. She&#8217;ll be all right and
happy, won&#8217;t you, Sheba?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Secretly Sheba felt some slight doubt of this; but in her
desire to do him credit, she summed up all her courage
and heroically answered that she would, and so was borne
off to the dining-room, where two girls were cutting bread
and slicing ham for supper. They were Mrs. Sparkes&#8217;s
daughters, and when they saw the child, dropped their
knives and made a good-natured rush at her, for which she
was not at all prepared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, mother,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;whar&#8217;s she from, &#8217;n who
does she b&#8217;long to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparkes cast a glance at her charge, which Sheba
caught and was puzzled by. It was a mysterious glance,
with something of cautious pity in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Set her up in a cheer, Luce,&#8221; she said, &#8220;&#8217;n give her a
piece of cake. Don&#8217;t ye want some, honey?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheba regarded her with uplifted eyes as she replied.
The glance had suggested to her mind that Mrs. Sparkes
was sorry for her, and she was anxious to know why.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;no, thank you, I don&#8217;t want any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sat quite still when they put her into a chair, but
she did not remove her eyes from Mrs. Sparkes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who does she b&#8217;long to, anyhow?&#8221; asked Luce.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparkes lowered her voice as she answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;She don&#8217;t b&#8217;long to nobody, gals,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s thet
little critter big Tom D&#8217;Willerby from Talbot&#8217;s Cross-roads
took to raise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye don&#8217;t say. Pore little thing,&#8221; exclaimed the girls.
And while one of them stooped to kiss her cheek, the other
hurriedly produced a large red apple, which she laid on the
long table before her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>But Sheba did not touch it. To hear that she belonged
to nobody was a mysterious shock to her. There had never
seemed any doubt before that she belonged to her Uncle
Tom, but Mrs. Sparkes had quite separated her from him
in her statement. Suddenly she began to feel a little tired,
and not quite so happy as she had been. But she sat still
and listened, rendered rather tremulous by the fact that
the speakers seemed so sure they had reason to pity her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef ever thar was a mystery,&#8221; Mrs. Sparkes proceeded,
&#8220;thet thar was one; though Molly Hollister says D&#8217;Willerby
don&#8217;t like it talked over. Nobody knowed &#8217;em, not
even their names, an&#8217; nobody knowed whar they come from.
She died, &#8217;n he went away&mdash;nobody knowed whar; &#8217;n the
child wasn&#8217;t two days old when he done it. Ye cayn&#8217;t tell
me thar ain&#8217;t a heap at the back o&#8217; that. They say D&#8217;Willerby&#8217;s
jest give himself up to her ever since, an&#8217; &#8217;tain&#8217;t no
wonder, nuther, for she&#8217;s a&#8217; out &#8217;n out beauty, ain&#8217;t she,
now? Just look at her eyes. Why don&#8217;t ye eat yer apple,
honey?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheba turned towards the window and looked out on the
porch. A bewildering sense of desolation had fallen upon
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want it,&#8221; she said; and her small voice had a
strange sound even in her own ears. &#8220;I want Uncle Tom.
Let me go out on the porch and see if he&#8217;s coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She saw them exchange rapid glances and was troubled
afresh by it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye reckin she understands?&#8221; the younger daughter
said, cautiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lordy, no!&#8221; answered the mother; &#8220;we ain&#8217;t said
nothin&#8217;. Ye kin go ef ye want to, Sheba,&#8221; she added,
cheerfully. &#8220;Thar&#8217;s a little rocking-cheer that ye kin set
in. Help her down, Luce.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>But she had already slipped down and found her way to
the door opening out on to the street. The porch was deserted
for a wonder, the reason being that an unusually
interesting case was being argued in the Court-house
across the street, where groups of men were hanging about
the doors. The rocking-chair stood in a corner, but
Sheba did not sit down in it. She went to the steps and
stood there, looking out with a sense of pain and loneliness
still hanging over her; and at last, without knowing why,
only feeling that they had a dreary sound and contained
a mystery which somehow troubled her, she began to say
over softly the words the woman had used.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She died and he went away, nobody knows where.
She died and he went away, nobody knows where.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Why those words should have clung to her and made
her feel for the moment desolate and helpless, it would be
difficult to say, but as she repeated them half unconsciously,
the figures of the woman who had died and the
man who had wandered so far away alone, that he seemed
to have wandered out of life itself, cast heavy shadows on
her childish heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;that it was not Uncle
Tom that went away.&#8221; And she looked up the street with
an anxious sigh.
</p>
<p>Just at this moment she became conscious that she was
not alone. In bending forward that she might see the
better, she caught sight of someone leaning against the
balustrades which had before concealed him&mdash;the boy, in
short, who was standing just as he had stood when they
drove up, and who looked as handsome in a darkling way
as human boy could look.
</p>
<p>For a few seconds the child regarded him with bated
breath. The boys she had been accustomed to seeing were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
not of this type, and were more remarkable for gifts less
ornamental than beauty. This boy with his graceful limbs
and haughtily carried head, filled her with awe and admiration.
She admired him so much, that, though her first
impulse was to run away, she did not obey it, and almost
immediately he glanced up and saw her. When this
occurred, she was greatly relieved to find that his gloom
did not lead him to treat her unkindly, indeed, he was
amiable enough to address her with an air of one relenting
and condescending somewhat to her youth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know I was here?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Sheba answered, timidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom are you looking for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For my Uncle Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He glanced across the street, still keeping his hands in
his pockets and preserving his easy attitude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he is over there,&#8221; he suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he is,&#8221; she replied, and added, shyly, &#8220;Are
you waiting for anyone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He frowned so darkly at first, that she was quite alarmed
and wished that she had run away as she had at first intended;
but he answered, after a pause:
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;yes;&#8221; he said, &#8220;yes&mdash;I&#8217;m waiting for my father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not even speak as the boys at the Cross-roads
spoke. His voice had a clear, soft ring, and his mode of
pronunciation was one Tom had spent much time in endeavouring
to impress upon herself as being more desirable
than that she had heard most commonly used
around her. Up to this time she had frequently wondered
why she must speak differently from Mornin and Molly
Hollister, but now she suddenly began to appreciate the
wisdom of his course. It was very much nicer to speak as
the boy spoke.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any father,&#8221; she ventured, &#8220;or any mother.
That&#8217;s queer, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; And as she said it, Mrs. Sparkes&#8217;s
words rushed into her mind again, and she looked up the
street towards the sunset and fell into a momentary reverie,
whispering them to herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you are saying?&#8221; asked the boy.
</p>
<p>She looked at him with a rather uncertain and troubled
expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was only what they said in there,&#8221; she replied,
pointing towards the dining-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She repeated the words slowly, regarding him fixedly,
because she wondered if they would have any effect upon
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She died and he went away, nobody knows where.
What does it mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he admitted, staring at her with his
handsome, long-lashed eyes. &#8220;Lots of people die and go
away.&#8221; Then, after a pause, in which he dropped his
eyes, he added:
</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother died two years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she?&#8221; answered Sheba, wondering why he looked
so gloomy again all at once. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I ever had
any mother, but I have Uncle Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stared at her again, and there was silence for a few
minutes. This he broke by asking a question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;De Willoughby,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but I&#8217;m called Sheba.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s my name,&#8221; he said, surprisedly. &#8220;My
name is De Willoughby. I&mdash;Hallo, Neb&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>This last in a tone of proprietorship to a negro servant,
who was advancing towards them from a side-door and
who hurried up with rather a frightened manner.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;d best get ready ter start right away, Mars Ralph,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s wake at las&#8217;, an&#8217; der&#8217;s de debbil to pay,
a-cussin&#8217; an&#8217; roarin&#8217; an&#8217; wantin&#8217; opium; an&#8217; he wants to
know whar ye bin an&#8217; what ye mean, an&#8217; ses de hosses mus&#8217;
be at de do&#8217; in ten minits. Oh, de cunnel he&#8217;s in de
wustest kin&#8217; o&#8217; humour, dar&#8217;s no doin&#8217; nuffin right fer
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him to go to h&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; burst forth the lad, flying
into a rage and looking so wickedly passionate in a boyish
way that Sheba was frightened again. &#8220;Tell him I won&#8217;t
go until I&#8217;m ready; I&#8217;ve been dragged round till I&#8217;m sick
of it, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the midst of his tempest he checked himself, turned
about and walked suddenly into the house, the negro following
him in evident trepidation.
</p>
<p>His departure was so sudden that Sheba fancied he
would return and say something more to her. Angry as
he looked, she wished very much that he would, and so
stood waiting wistfully.
</p>
<p>But she was doomed to disappointment. In a few
minutes the negro brought to the front three horses, and
almost immediately there appeared at the door a tall,
handsome man, who made his way to the finest horse and
mounted it with a dashing vault into the saddle.
</p>
<p>He had a dark aquiline face like the boy&#8217;s, and wore a
great sweeping mustache which hid his mouth. The boy
followed, looking wonderfully like him, as he sprang into
his own saddle with the same dare-devil vault.
</p>
<p>No one spoke a word, and he did not even look at Sheba,
though she watched him with admiring and longing eyes.
As soon as they were fairly in their seats the horses, which
were fine creatures, needing neither whip nor spur, sprang
forward with a light, easy movement, and so cantered down
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
the street towards the high road which stretched itself
over a low hill about a quarter of a mile away.
</p>
<p>Sheba laid her cheek against the wooden pillar and
looked after them with a return of the sense of loneliness
she had felt before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He went away,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;nobody knows
where&mdash;nobody knows where.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She felt Tom&#8217;s hand laid on her shoulder as she said the
words, and turned her face upward with a consciousness
of relief, knowing she would not be lonely any longer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I been gone long?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Mrs.
Sparkes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in there,&#8221; Sheba answered, eagerly, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve
been talking to the boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the boy?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;What boy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the one we saw,&#8221; she replied, holding his hand
and feeling her cheeks flush with the excitement of relating
her adventure. &#8220;The nice boy. His name is like
mine&mdash;and his mother died. He said it was De Willoughby,
and it is like mine. He has gone away with his
father. See them riding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He dropped her hand and, taking a step forward, stood
watching the receding travellers. He watched them until
they reached the rising ground. The boy had fallen a few
yards behind. Presently the others passed the top of the
hill, and, as they did so, he turned in his saddle as if he
had suddenly remembered something, and glanced back at
the tavern porch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is looking for me,&#8221; cried Sheba, and ran out into
the brightness of the setting sun, happy because he had
not quite forgotten her.
</p>
<p>He saw her, waved his hand with a careless, boyish
gesture and disappeared over the brow of the hill.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>Tom sat down suddenly on the porch-step. When
Sheba turned to him he was pale and his forehead was
damp with sweat. He spoke aloud, but to himself, not to
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s De Courcy and&mdash;and the
boy. That was why I knew his face.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When they went in to supper later on, there was a great
deal of laughing and talking going on down the long table.
Mr. Sparkes was finishing a story as they entered, and he
was finishing it in a loud voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re pretty well known,&#8221; he said; &#8220;an&#8217; the Colonel&#8217;s
the worst o&#8217; the lot. The nigger told me thar&#8217;d
been a reg&#8217;lar flare-up at the Springs. Thar was a ball an&#8217;
he got on a tear an&#8217; got away from &#8217;em an&#8217; bust right into
the ballroom an&#8217; played Hail Columby. He&#8217;s a pop&#8217;lar
man among the ladies, is the Colonel, but a mixtry of
whiskey an&#8217; opium is apt to spile his manners. Nigger
says he&#8217;s the drunkest man when he is drunk that the
Lord ever let live. Ye cayn&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; with him. The
boy was thar, an&#8217; they say &#8217;twas a sight ter see him. He&#8217;s
his daddy&#8217;s son, an&#8217; a bigger young devil never lived, they
tell me. He&#8217;s not got to the whiskey an&#8217; opium yet, an&#8217;
he jes&#8217; takes his&#8217;n out in pride an&#8217; temper. Nigger said he
jest raved an&#8217; tore that night&mdash;went into the Colonel&#8217;s
room an&#8217; cussed an&#8217; dashed round like he was gone mad.
Kinder shamed, I reckin. But Lord, he&#8217;ll be at it himself
in ten years from now. It&#8217;s in the blood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that you&#8217;re talking of?&#8221; asked Tom from his
end of the table. He had not recovered his colour yet and
looked pale as he put the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel De Willoughby of Delisleville,&#8221; answered Mr.
Sparkes. &#8220;Any kin o&#8217; your&#8217;n? Name&#8217;s sorter like. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
jest left here this evenin&#8217; with his boy an&#8217; nigger. They&#8217;ve
ben to Whitebriar, an&#8217; they&#8217;re on their way home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw them ride over the hill,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;I thought
I wasn&#8217;t mistaken in the man. I&#8217;ve seen him before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But he made a very poor supper, and a shadow seemed
to have fallen upon his cheery mood of the morning.
Sheba recognised this and knew, too, that her new friend
and his father were in some vague way responsible for it,
and the knowledge oppressed her so that when they sat out
upon the porch together after the meal was over, she in her
accustomed place on his knee, she grew sad under it herself
and, instead of talking as usual, leaned her small head
against his coat and watched the few stars whose brightness
the moon had not shut out.
</p>
<p>She went to bed early, but did not sleep well, dreaming
dreary dreams of watching the travellers riding away towards
the sunset, and of hearing the woman talk again.
One of the talkers seemed at last to waken her with her
voice, and she sat up in bed suddenly and found that it
was Tom, who had roused her by speaking to himself in a
low tone as he stood in a flood of moonlight before the
window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She died,&#8221; he was saying; &#8220;she died.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheba burst into a little sob, stretching out her hands to
him without comprehending her own emotion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And he went away,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;nobody knows where&mdash;nobody
knows where&mdash;&#8221; And even when he came to
her hurriedly and sat down on the bedside, soothing her
and taking her in his arms to sink back into slumber, she
sobbed drearily two or three times, though, once in his
clasp, she felt, as she had always done, the full sense of
comfort, safety, and rest.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p>The New England town of Willowfield was a place of
great importance. Its importance&mdash;religious, intellectual,
and social&mdash;was its strong point. It took the liberty of asserting
this with unflinching dignity. Other towns might
endeavour to struggle to the front, and, indeed, did so endeavour,
but Willowfield calmly held its place and remained
unmoved. Its place always had been at the front from the
first, and there it took its stand. It had, perhaps, been
hinted that its sole title to this position lay in its own stately
assumption: but this, it may be argued, was sheer envy and
entirely unworthy of notice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Willowfield is not very large or very rich,&#8221; its leading
old lady said, &#8220;but it is important and has always been considered
so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was society in Willowfield, society which had taken
up its abiding-place in three or four streets and confined itself
to developing its importance in half a dozen families&mdash;old
families. They were always spoken of as the &#8220;old families,&#8221;
and, to be a member of one of them, even a second or
third cousin of weak mind and feeble understanding, was
to be enclosed within the magic circle outside of which was
darkness, wailing, and gnashing of teeth. There were the
Stornaways, who had owned the button factory for nearly a
generation and a half&mdash;which was a long time; the Downings,
who had kept the feed-store for quite thirty years,
and the Burtons, who had been doctors for almost as long,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
not to mention the Larkins, who had actually founded the
Willowfield <i>Times</i>, and kept it going, which had scarcely
been expected of them at the outset.
</p>
<p>Their moral, mental, and social gifts notwithstanding,
there was nothing connected with the Stornaways, the Downings,
the Burtons, and the Larkins of such importance as
their antiquity. The uninformed outsider, on hearing it
descanted upon, might naturally have been betrayed into the
momentary weakness of expecting to see Mr. Downing moulder
away, and little old Doctor Burton crumble into dust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They belong,&#8221; it was said, with the temperateness of
true dignity, &#8220;to our old families, and that is something,
you know, even in America.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has struck me,&#8221; an observing male visitor once remarked,
&#8220;that there are a good many women in Willowfield,
and that altogether it has a feminine tone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was certainly true that among the Stornaways, the
Downings, the Burtons, and the Larkins, the prevailing tone
was feminine; and as the Stornaways, the Downings, the
Burtons, and the Larkins comprised Willowfield society, and
without its society Willowfield lost its significance, the observing
male visitor may not have been far wrong. If mistakes
were made in Willowfield society, they were always
made by the masculine members of it. It was Mr. Stornaway
who had at one time been betrayed into the blunder of inviting
to a dinner-party at his house a rather clever young
book-keeper in his employ, and it was Doctor Burton who
had wandered still more glaringly from the path of rectitude
by taking a weak, if amiable, interest in a little music teacher
with a sweet, tender voice, even going so far as to request
his family to call upon her and ask her to take tea with
them. It was Mr. Downing, who, when this last incident
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
occurred and created some sensation, had had the temerity
to intimate that he thought the Doctor was entirely in the
right; though, to be sure, he had afterwards been led to falter
in this opinion and subside into craven silence, being a
little gentleman of timorous and yielding nature, and rather
overborne by a large and powerful feminine majority in his
own household. Mr. Larkin was, it is to be regretted, the
worst of the recreant party, being younger and more unmanageable,
having not only introduced to public notice certain
insignificant though somewhat talented persons in the shape
of young men and women who talked well, or sang well,
or wielded lively pens, but had gone to the length of standing
by them unflinchingly, demanding civility for them at the
hands of his own family of women in such a manner as
struck a deadly blow at the very foundations of the social
structure. But Mr. Larkin&mdash;he was known as Jack Larkin
to an astonishing number of people&mdash;was a bold man by
nature and given to deeds of daring, from the fatal consequences
of which nothing but the fact that he was a member
of one of the &#8220;old families&#8221; could have saved him. As he
was a part&mdash;and quite a large part&mdash;of one of these venerable
households, and, moreover, knew not the fear of man&mdash;or
woman&mdash;his failings could be referred to as &#8220;eccentricities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Larkin,&#8221; Mrs. Stornaway frequently observed, with
long-suffering patience, &#8220;is talented but eccentric. You
are never quite sure what he will do next.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Stornaway was the head and front of all Willowfield&#8217;s
social efforts, and represented the button factory with
a lofty grace and unbending dignity of demeanour which
were the admiration and envy of all aspirants to social fame.
It was said that Mrs. Stornaway had been a beauty in her
youth, and there were those who placed confidence in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
rumour. Mrs. Stornaway did so herself, and it had been
intimated that it was this excellent lady who had vouched
for the truth of the statement in the first instance; but this
report having been traced to a pert young relative who detested
and derided her, might have had its origin in youthful
disrespect and malice.
</p>
<p>At present Mrs. Stornaway was a large blonde woman
whose blondness was not fairness, and whose size was not
roundness. She was the leader of all religious and charitable
movements, presiding with great vigour over church matters,
fairs, concerts, and sewing societies. The minister of
her church submitted himself to her advice and guidance.
All the modest members of the choir quailed and quavered
before her, while even the bold ones, meeting her eye when
engaged in worldly conversation between their musical efforts,
momentarily lost their interest and involuntarily
straightened themselves.
</p>
<p>Towards her family Mrs. Stornaway performed her duty
with unflinching virtue. She had married her six daughters
in a manner at once creditable to herself, themselves, and
Willowfield. Five of them had been rather ordinary, depressed-looking
girls, who, perhaps, were not sorry to obtain
their freedom. The sixth had narrowly escaped being dowered
with all the charms said to have adorned Mrs. Stornaway&#8217;s
own youth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Agnes is very like what I was at her age,&#8221; said her
mother, with dignity; and perhaps she was, though no one
had been able to trace any resemblance which had defied the
ravages of time.
</p>
<p>Agnes had made a marriage which in some points was
better than those of her sisters. She had married a brilliant
man, while the other five had been obliged to make the best
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
of things as far as brilliancy was concerned. People always
said of John Baird that he was a brilliant man and that
a great career lay before him. He was rather remarkable for
a curious subtle distinction of physical good looks. He was
not of the common, straight-featured, personable type. It
had been said by the artistic analyst of form and line that
his aspect did not belong to his period, that indeed his
emotional, spirited face, with its look of sensitiveness and
race, was of the type once connected with fine old steel
engravings of young poets not quite beyond the days of
powdered hair and frilled shirt-bosoms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is absurd that he should have been born in America
and in these days,&#8221; a brilliant person had declared. &#8220;He
always brings to my mind the portraits in delightful old
annuals, &#8216;So-and-so&mdash;at twenty-five.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>His supple ease of movement and graceful length of limb
gave him an air of youth. He was one of the creatures to
whom the passage of years would mean but little, but added
charm and adaptability. His eyes were singularly living
things&mdash;the eyes that almost unconsciously entreat and
whose entreaty touches one; the fine, irregular outline of
his profile was the absolute expression of the emotional at
war with itself, the passionate, the tender, the sensitive, and
complex. The effect of these things was almost the effect
of peculiar physical beauty, and with this he combined the
allurements of a compelling voice and an enviable sense of
the fitness of things. He never lost a thought through the
inability to utter it. When he had left college, he had left
burdened with honours and had borne with him the enthusiastic
admiration of his fellow-students. He had earned
and worn his laurels with an ease and grace which would
be remembered through years to come.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something,&#8221; it was once said, &#8220;to have known a
fellow to whom things came so easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he had entered the ministry, there had been some
wonder expressed among the men who had known him best,
but when he preached his first sermon at Willowfield, where
there was a very desirable church indeed, with whose minister
Mrs. Stornaway had become dissatisfied, and who in consequence
was to be civilly removed, the golden apple fell
at once into his hand.
</p>
<p>Before he had arrived he had been spoken of rather slightingly
as &#8220;the young man,&#8221; but when he rose in the pulpit
on the eventful Sunday morning, such a thrill ran through
the congregation as had not stirred it at its devotions for
many a summer day. Mrs. Stornaway mentally decided for
him upon the spot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is of one of our oldest families,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This
is what Willowfield wants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He dined with the Stornaways that day, and when he entered
the parlour the first figure his eyes fell upon was that
of Agnes Stornaway, dressed in white muslin, with white
roses in her belt. She was a tall girl, with a willowy figure
and a colourless fairness of skin, but when her mother called
her to her side and Baird touched her hand, she blushed in
such a manner that Mrs. Stornaway was a little astonished.
Scarcely a year afterward she became Mrs. Baird, and people
said she was a very fortunate girl, which was possibly true.
</p>
<p>Her husband did not share the fate of most ministers who
had presided over Mrs. Stornaway&#8217;s church. His power over
his congregation increased every year. His name began to
be known in the world of literature; he was called upon
to deliver in important places the lectures he had delivered
to his Willowfield audiences, and the result was one startling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
triumph after another. There was every indication of the
fact that a career was already marked out for him.
</p>
<p>Willowfield looked forward with trepidation to the time
when the great world which stood ready to give him fame
would absorb him altogether, but in the meantime it exerted
all its power of fascination, and was so far successful that
the Reverend John Baird felt that his lines had indeed fallen
in pleasant places.
</p>
<p>But after the birth of her little daughter his wife was not
strong, and was so long in regaining vitality that in the
child&#8217;s second year she was ordered abroad by the physician.
At this time Baird&#8217;s engagements were such that he could
not accompany her, and accordingly he remained in America.
The career was just opening up its charmed vistas to him;
his literary efforts were winning laurels; he was called upon
to lecture in Boston and New York, and he never rose before
an audience without at once awakening an enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Baird went to the south of France with her child
and nurse and a party of friends, and remained there for
a year. At the termination of that time, just as she thought
of returning home, she was taken seriously ill. Her husband
was sent for and went at once to join her. In a few months
she had died of rapid decline. She had been a delicate
girl, and a far-off taint of consumption in her family blood
had reasserted itself. But though Mrs. Stornaway bewailed
her with diffuse and loud pathos and for a year swathed her
opulence of form in deepest folds and draperies of crape,
the quiet fairness and slightness which for some five and
twenty years had been known as Agnes Stornaway, had been
a personality not likely to be a marked and long-lingering
memory.
</p>
<p>The child was placed with a motherly friend in Paris.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
For a month after his wife&#8217;s death Baird had been feverishly,
miserably eager to return to America. Those about
him felt that the blow which had fallen upon him might
affect his health seriously. He seemed possessed by a desperate,
morbid desire to leave the scene of the calamity behind
him. He was restless and feverish in his anxiety, and
scarcely able to endure the delay which the arrangement
of his affairs made necessary. He had not been well when
he had left Willowfield, and during his watching by his wife&#8217;s
bedside he had grown thin and restless-eyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to get home. I must get home,&#8221; he would exclaim,
as if involuntarily. His entire physical and mental
condition were strained and unnatural. His wife&#8217;s doctor,
who had become his own doctor as his health deteriorated,
was not surprised, on arriving one day, to find him prostrated
with nervous fever. He was ill for months, and he rose from
his sick-bed a depressed shadow of his former self and
quite unable to think of returning to his charge, even if his
old desire had not utterly left him with his fever. He was
absent from Willowfield for two years, and when at length
he turned his face homeward, it was with no eagerness. He
had passed through one of those phases which change a
man&#8217;s life and being. If he had been a rich man he would
have remained away and would have lived in London, seeing
much of the chief continental cities. As it was, he must
at least temporarily return to Willowfield and take with him
his little girl.
</p>
<p>On the day distinguished by his return to his people, much
subdued excitement prevailed in Willowfield. During the
whole of the previous week Mrs. Stornaway&#8217;s carriage had
paid daily visits to the down-town stores. There was a flourishing
New England thrift among the Stornaways, the Larkins,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
the Downings, and the Burtons, which did not allow
of their delegating the ordering of their households to assistants.
Most of them were rigorous housewives, keen
at a bargain and sharp of tongue when need be, and there
was rarely any danger of their getting less than their money&#8217;s
worth.
</p>
<p>To celebrate his arrival, Mrs. Stornaway was to give an
evening party which was to combine congratulatory welcome
with a touch of condolence for the past and assurance for
the future.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must let him see,&#8221; said Mrs. Stornaway, &#8220;that Willowfield
has its attractions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Its attractions did not present themselves as vividly to
John Baird as might have been hoped, when he descended
from the train at the depot. He had spent two or three
days in Boston with a view to taking his change gradually,
but he found himself not as fully prepared for Willowfield
as he could have wished. He was not entirely prepared for
Mrs. Stornaway, who hurried towards them with exultation
on her large, stupid face, and, after effusive embraces, bustled
with them towards an elderly woman who had evidently
accompanied her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See, here&#8217;s Miss Amory Starkweather!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;She came with me to meet you. Just see how Annie&#8217;s
grown, Miss Amory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Amory was a thin woman with a strong-featured
countenance and deep-set, observing eyes. They were eyes
whose expression suggested that they had made many painful
discoveries in the course of their owner&#8217;s life.
</p>
<p>John Baird rather lighted up for a moment when he
caught sight of her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you, Miss Amory,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I hope you are as well
as you look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re so delighted,&#8221; Mrs. Stornaway announced, as if
to the bystanders. &#8220;Everybody in Willowfield is so delighted
to have you back again. The church has not seemed
the same place. The man who took your place&mdash;Mr. Jeramy,
you know&mdash;you haven&#8217;t any idea how unpopular&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said Baird, &#8220;I must speak to Latimer.
Where is Latimer, Annie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Latimer?&#8221; asked Mrs. Stornaway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said Baird again, and turning back towards
the platform, he disappeared among the crowd with Annie,
who had clung to his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s gone!&#8221; proclaimed Mrs. Stornaway. &#8220;But
where&#8217;s he gone? Why didn&#8217;t he stay? Who&#8217;s Latimer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Latimer!&#8221; Miss Amory echoed, &#8220;you ought to know
him. His family lives in Willowfield. He is the man who
was coming home to take charge of the little church at Janway&#8217;s
Mills. He has evidently crossed the Atlantic with
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, I declare,&#8221; proclaimed Mrs. Stornaway. &#8220;It
must be the man who took his sister to Europe. It was a
kind of absurd thing. She died away&mdash;the girl did, and
people wondered why he did not come back and how he
lived. Why, yes, that must be the man.&#8221; And she turned
to look about for him.
</p>
<p>Miss Amory Starkweather made a slight movement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He might not like to be stared
at.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re quite common people,&#8221; commented Mrs. Stornaway,
still staring. &#8220;They live in a little house in a side
street. They had very silly ideas about the girl. They
thought she was a genius and sent her to the School of Art
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
in Boston, but it wasn&#8217;t long before her health failed her.
Ah! I guess that must be the man talking to Mr. Baird and
Annie. He looks as if he would go off in a consumption.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was a tall, hollow-chested man, with a dark, sallow
face and an ungainly figure. There were suggestions of both
ill-health and wretchedness in his appearance, and his manner
was awkward and embarrassed. Two human beings more
utterly unlike each other than himself and the man who held
his hand could not possibly have been found. It was Baird
who held his hand, not he Baird&#8217;s, and it was Baird who
seemed to speak while he listened, while with his free hand
he touched the hair of the child Annie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Stornaway, &#8220;Mr. Baird seems to
have taken a fancy to him. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s attractive
myself. Are they going to talk to him all day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Miss Amory, &#8220;he is going now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was going. Baird had released his hand and he was
looking in a gloomy, awkward way at Annie, as if he did
not know how to make his adieux. But Annie, who was
a simple child creature, solved the difficulty for him with
happy readiness. She flung both her small arms about his
ungainly body and held up her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiss me three times,&#8221; she said; &#8220;three times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer started and flushed. He looked down at her and
then glanced rather timidly at Baird.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiss her,&#8221; said Baird, &#8220;it will please her&mdash;and it will
please me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer bent himself to the child&#8217;s height and kissed her.
The act was without grace, and when he stood upright he
was more awkward and embarrassed than ever. But the
caress was not a cold or rough one, and when he turned
and strode away the flush was still on his sallow cheek.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p>The Stornaway parlours were very brilliant that evening
in a Willowfield sense. Not a Burton, a Larkin, or a Downing
was missing, even Miss Amory Starkweather being present.
Miss Amory Starkweather was greatly respected by
the Stornaways, the Downings, the Larkins, and the Burtons,
the Starkweathers having landed upon Plymouth Rock so
early and with such a distinguished sense of their own importance
as to lead to the impression in weak minds that
they had not only founded that monumental corner-stone
of ancestry, but were personally responsible for the Mayflower.
This gentlewoman represented to the humorous
something more of the element of comedy than she represented
to herself. She had been born into a world too narrow
and provincial for the development of the powers born with
her. She had been an ugly girl and an ugly woman, marked
by the hopeless ugliness of a long, ill-proportioned face,
small eyes, and a nose too large and high&mdash;that ugliness
which even love&#8217;s eyes can scarcely ameliorate into good
drawing.
</p>
<p>The temperament attached to these painful disabilities
had been warm and strongly womanly. Born a century
or so earlier, in a French Court, or any great world vivid
with picturesque living, she would in all probability have
been a remarkable personage, her ugliness a sort of distinction;
but she had been born in Willowfield, and had lived
its life and been bound by its limits. She had been comfortably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
well off&mdash;she had a large square house with a garden,
an income sufficient to provide for extremely respectable
existence in Willowfield, but not large enough to allow
of experiments with the outside world. She had never met
a man whom she could have loved, who would have loved
her, and she was essentially&mdash;though Willowfield would
never have dreamed it&mdash;a woman who should have loved
and mated. A lifetime of narrow, unstimulating years and
thwarted instincts had made age treat her ill. She was a
thin woman with burning eyes, and a personality people
were afraid of.
</p>
<p>She had always found an interest in John Baird. When
he had come to Willowfield she had seen in him that element
which her whole long life had lacked. His emotional potentialities
had wakened her imagination. If she had been a
young woman she knew that she might have fallen tragically
and hopelessly in love with him; as an old woman
she found it well worth her while to watch him and speculate
upon him. When he had become engaged to Agnes
Stornaway, she had watched him and secretly wondered how
the engagement would end; when it had ended in marriage
she had not wondered, but she had seen many things other
people did not see. &#8220;He is not in love with her,&#8221; had been
her mental decision, &#8220;but he is emotional, and he is in love
with her being in love with him. There is no foretelling
what will come of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird had found himself attracted by Miss Amory. He
did not know that if she had been young she would, despite
her ugliness, have had a powerful feminine effect on him.
He used to go and talk to her, and he was not conscious that
he went when he was made restless by a lack of something
in the mental atmosphere about him. He could talk to her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
as he could not talk to the rest of Willowfield. She read
and thought and argued with herself, and as a product of
a provincial dogmatic New England town was a curious development.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you once a brilliant, wicked, feminine mover of
things in some old French court?&#8221; he said to her once.
</p>
<p>They had been plunging deep into the solving of unsolvable
problems, and she turned her burning old eyes on him
as she answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows what I was,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but it was nothing
like this&mdash;nothing like this&mdash;and I was not wicked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Baird replied, &#8220;you were not wicked; but you
broke laws.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I broke laws,&#8221; she agreed; &#8220;but they were hideous
laws&mdash;better broken than kept.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had been puzzled by the fact that after his wife left
him he had had a restless period and had seemed to pass
through a miserable phase, such as a man suffering from
love and longing might endure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he fallen in love with her because she has gone
away?&#8221; she wondered; &#8220;men are capable of it at times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But later she decided mentally that this was not his special
case. She saw, however, that he was passing through some
mental crisis which was a dangerous struggle. He was restless
and often away from Willowfield for two or three days
at a time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To provide the place with orthodox doctrine once a week
is more than he can bear, and to be bored to extinction into
the bargain makes him feel morbid,&#8221; she said to herself.
&#8220;I hope he won&#8217;t begin to be lured by things which might
produce catastrophe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Once he came and spent a long, hot summer evening with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
her, and when he went away she had arrived at another
decision, and it made her wretched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is lured,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I cannot help him, and
God knows Willowfield could not. After this&mdash;perhaps the
Deluge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She saw but little of him for two months, and then he
was called across the Atlantic by his wife&#8217;s illness and left
the place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Write to me now and then,&#8221; he said, when he came to
bid her good-bye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I write about from Willowfield to a man in
Paris?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About Willowfield,&#8221; he answered, holding her hand and
laughing a little gruesomely. &#8220;There will be a thrill in it
when one is three thousand miles away. Tell me about the
church&mdash;about the people&mdash;who comes, who goes&mdash;your
own points of view will make it all worth while. Will
you?&#8221; almost as if a shade anxiously.
</p>
<p>She felt the implied flattery just enough to be vaguely
pleased by it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will,&#8221; she answered.
</p>
<p>She kept her word, and the letters were worth reading. It
was, as he had said, her points of view which gave interest
to the facts that unexciting people had died, married, or
been born. Her sketch of the trying position of the unpopular
man who filled his pulpit and was unfavourably
compared with him every Sunday morning was full of astute
analysis and wit; her little picture of the gloomy young
theological student, Latimer, his efforts for his sister, and
her innocent, pathetic death in a foreign land had a wonderful
realism of touch. She had by pure accident made the
child&#8217;s acquaintance and had been strongly touched and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
moved. She did not write often, but he read her letters
many times over.
</p>
<p>Upon this evening of his home-coming she thought he had
sometimes the look of a man who felt that he walked in a
dream. More than once she saw him involuntarily pass his
hand with a swift movement over his eyes as if his own
touch might waken him. It was true he did not greatly
enjoy the festivities. His occasional views of Mrs. Stornaway
as she rambled among her guests, talking to them
about him in audible tones, were trying. She dispensed
him with her hospitalities, as it were, and was diffuse upon
the extent of his travels and the attention paid him, to each
member of the company in turn. He knew when she was
speaking of himself and when of her daughter, and the
alternate decorous sentiment and triumphant pleasure
marked on her broad face rasped him to the extent of making
him fear lest he might lose his temper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a stupid woman,&#8221; he found himself saying half
aloud once; &#8220;the most stupid woman I think I ever met.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Towards the end of the evening, as he entered the room,
he found himself obliged to pass her. She stood near the
door, engaged in animated conversation with Mrs. Downing.
She had hit upon a new and absorbing topic, which had the
additional charge of savouring of local gossip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he heard her say, &#8220;I mean to ask him. He
can tell us, I guess. I haven&#8217;t a doubt but he heard the
whole story. You know he has a way of drawing people
out. He&#8217;s so much tact and sympathy. I used to tell Agnes
he was all tact and sympathy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Feeling quite sure that it was himself who was &#8220;all tact
and sympathy,&#8221; Baird endeavoured to move by unobserved,
but she caught sight of him and checked his progress.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Baird,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we&#8217;re just talking about you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about me,&#8221; he said, lightly; &#8220;I am not half
so culpable as I look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He often found small change of this order could be made
useful with Mrs. Stornaway, and he bestowed this upon her
with an easy air which she felt to be very delightful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s so ready,&#8221; she observed, enraptured; &#8220;I often used
to say to Agnes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Mrs. Downing was not to be defrauded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were talking about those people on Bank Street,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;the Latimers. Mrs. Stornaway says you crossed
the Atlantic with the son, who has just come back. Do
tell us something about him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I cannot make him as interesting to you
as he was to me,&#8221; answered Baird, with his light air again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He does not look very interesting,&#8221; said Mrs. Stornaway.
&#8220;I never saw anyone so sallow; I can&#8217;t understand Annie
liking him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is interesting,&#8221; responded Baird. &#8220;Annie took one
of her fancies to him, and I took something more than a
fancy. We shall be good friends, I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s very kind of you to take such an interest,&#8221;
proclaimed Mrs. Stornaway. &#8220;You are always
finding something good in people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish people were always finding something good in
me,&#8221; said John Baird. &#8220;It was not difficult to find good
in this man. He is of the stuff they made saints and martyrs
of in the olden times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did the girl die of?&#8221; asked Mrs. Downing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; repeated Baird. &#8220;The girl? I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And where did she die?&#8221; added Mrs. Downing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just saying,&#8221; put in Mrs. Stornaway, &#8220;that you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
had such a sympathetic way of drawing people out that I
was sure he had told you the whole story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was not much story,&#8221; Baird answered, &#8220;and it
was too sad to talk over. The poor child went abroad
and died in some little place in Italy&mdash;of consumption,
I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose she was sick when they went,&#8221; commented
Mrs. Downing. &#8220;I heard so. It was a queer thing for
them to go to Europe, as inexperienced as they were and
everything. But the father and mother were more inexperienced
still, I guess. They were perfectly foolish about
the girl&mdash;and so was the brother. She went to some studio
in Boston to study art, and they had an idea her bits of
pictures were wonderful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw her myself,&#8221; said Mrs. Stornaway. &#8220;No
one seems to have seen anything of her but Miss Amory
Starkweather.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Starkweather!&#8221; exclaimed Baird. &#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;in
her letters she mentioned having met her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was a queer thing,&#8221; said Mrs. Downing, &#8220;but
it was like Miss Amory. They say the girl fainted in the
street as Miss Amory was driving by, and she stopped her
carriage and took her in and carried her home. She took
quite a fancy to her and saw her every day or so until she
went away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not unnatural that at this juncture John Baird&#8217;s
eyes should wander across the room to where Miss Amory
Starkweather sat, but it was a coincidence that as his eye
fell upon her she should meet it with a gesture which called
him to her side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that Miss Amory wishes to speak to me,&#8221; he
said to his companions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll make himself just as interesting to her as he has
made himself to us,&#8221; said Mrs. Stornaway, with heavy
sprightliness, as he left them. &#8220;He never spares himself
trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went across the room to Miss Amory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you sit down by me?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to talk
to you about Lucien Latimer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is there in the atmosphere which suggests Latimer?&#8221;
he inquired. &#8220;We have been talking about him
at the other side of the room. Do you know him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw him,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but I knew her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her!&#8221; he repeated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The little sister.&#8221; She leaned forward a little. &#8220;What
were the details of her death?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I want to
know&mdash;I want to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somehow the words sounded nervously eager.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not ask him,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;I thought he preferred
to be silent. He is a silent man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sat upright again, and for a moment seemed to forget
herself. She said something two or three times softly
to herself. Baird thought it was &#8220;Poor child! Poor
child!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was young to die,&#8221; he said, in a low voice. &#8220;Poor
child, indeed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Amory came back to him, as it were.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The younger, the better,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Look at me!&#8221;
Her burning eyes were troubling and suggestive. Baird
found himself trying to gather himself together. He assumed
the natural air of kindly remonstrance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take that tone. It is
unfair to all of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her reply was certainly rather a startling one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; she responded. &#8220;Look at yourself.
If you had died as young as she did&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at her, conscious of a little coldness creeping
over his body. She was usually lighter when they were
not entirely alone. Just now, in the midst of this commonplace,
exceedingly middle-class evening party, with the
Larkins, the Downings, and the Burtons chattering, warm,
diffuse, and elate, about him, she stirred him with a little
horror&mdash;not horror of herself, but of something in her
mood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I am such a bad fellow?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Worse, poor thing. It is not
the bad fellows who produce the crudest results. But I
did not call you here to tell you that you were bad or good.
I called you to speak about Lucien Latimer. When you go
to him&mdash;you are going to him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell him to come and see me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell him anything you wish,&#8221; said Baird. &#8220;Is
there anything else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him I knew her,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;Margery&mdash;Margery!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery,&#8221; Baird said slowly, as if the sound touched
him. &#8220;What a pretty, simple name!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was a pretty, simple creature,&#8221; said Miss Amory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me&mdash;&#8221; he said, &#8220;tell me something more about
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing more to tell,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;She was
dying when I met her. I saw it&mdash;in her eyes. She could
not have lived. She went away and died. She&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Baird heard a slight sharp choking sound in her
throat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she said presently, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to talk about
it. I am too emotional for my years. Go to Mrs. Stornaway.
She is looking for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got up and turned and left her without speaking,
and a few minutes later, when Mrs. Stornaway wanted him
to give an account of his interview with the Pope, she was
surprised to see him approaching her from the door as if
he had been out of the room.
</p>
<p>His story of the interview with the Pope was very interesting,
and he was more &#8220;brilliant&#8221; than ever during
the remainder of the evening, but when the last guest had
departed, followed by Mrs. Stornaway to the threshold,
that lady, on her return to the parlour, found him standing
by the mantel looking at the fire with so profoundly
wearied an air, that she uttered an exclamation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you look tired, I must say. But
everything went off splendidly and I never saw you so
brilliant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been saying,&#8221; with renewed spirit of admiration,
&#8220;that your crossing with that Latimer has quite
brought him into notice. It will be a good thing for him.
I heard several people speak of him to-night and say how
kind it was of you to take him up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird stirred uneasily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should not like to have that tone taken,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Why should I patronise him? We shall be friends&mdash;if
he will allow it.&#8221; He spoke with so much heat and impatience
that Mrs. Stornaway listened with a discomfited stare.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But nobody knows anything about them,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;They&#8217;re quite ordinary people. They live in Bank
Street.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That may settle the matter for Willowfield,&#8221; said
Baird, &#8220;but it does not settle it for me. We are to be
friends, and Willowfield must understand that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And such was the decision of his tone that Mrs. Stornaway
did not recover herself and was still staring after
him in a bewildered fashion when he went upstairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s just like him,&#8221; she remarked, rather weakly
to the room&#8217;s emptiness. &#8220;That&#8217;s always the way with
people of genius and&mdash;and&mdash;<i>mind</i>. They&#8217;re always humble.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p>She had renewed opportunity for remarking upon the
generous humility the next morning when he left the house
with the intention of paying his visit to Bank Street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s actually going,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Well, I must say
again it&#8217;s just like him. There are very few men in his
position who would think it worth while, but he treats
everybody with just as much consideration as if&mdash;as if he
was nobody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The house on Bank Street was just what he had expected
to find it&mdash;small, unornamental, painted white, and modestly
putting forth a few vines as if with a desire to clothe
itself, which had not been encouraged by Nature. The
vines had not flourished and they, as well as the few flowers
in the yard, were dropping their scant foliage, which turned
brown and rustled in the autumn wind.
</p>
<p>Before ringing the bell, Baird stood for a few moments
upon the threshold. As he looked up and down the street,
he was pale and felt chilly, so chilly that he buttoned his
light overcoat over his breast and his hands even shook
slightly as he did it. Then he turned and rang the bell.
</p>
<p>It was answered by a little woman with a girlish figure
and gray hair. For a moment John Baird paused before
speaking to her, as he had paused before ringing the bell,
and in the pause, during which he found himself looking
into her soft, childishly blue eyes, he felt even chillier than
at first.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Latimer. I think,&#8221; he said, baring his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;and you are Mr. Baird and have
come to see Lucien, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She gave him her small hand with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad to see you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and Lucien will
be glad, too. Come in, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She led the way into the little parlour, talking in a voice
as soft and kindly as her eyes. Lucien had been out, but
had just come in, she fancied, and was probably upstairs.
She would go and tell him.
</p>
<p>So, having taken him into the room, she went, leaving
him alone. When she was gone, Baird stood for a moment
listening to her footsteps upon the stairs. Then he crossed
the room and stood before the hearth looking up at a
picture which hung over the mantel.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>He was still standing before it when she returned with
her son. He turned slowly to confront them, holding out
his hand to Latimer with something less of alert and sympathetic
readiness than was usual with him. There was in
his manner an element which corresponded with the lack
of colour and warmth in his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking at this portrait of your&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he
began.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of Margery,&#8221; put in the little mother. &#8220;Everyone
looks at Margery when they come in. It seems as if the
child somehow filled the room.&#8221; And though her soft
voice had a sigh in it, she did not speak in entire sadness.
</p>
<p>John Baird looked at the picture again. It was the
portrait of a slight small girl with wistful eyes and an innocent
face.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I felt sure that it was she,&#8221; he said in a lowered voice,
&#8220;and you are quite right in saying that she seems to fill
the room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The mother put her hand upon her son&#8217;s arm. He had
turned his face towards the window. It seemed to Baird
that her light touch was at once an appeal and a consolation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She filled the whole house when she was here,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;and yet she was only a quiet little thing. She had
a bright way with her quietness and was so happy and busy.
It is my comfort now to remember that she was always
happy&mdash;happy to the last, Lucien tells me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked up at her son&#8217;s averted face as if expecting
him to speak, and he responded at once, though in his usual
mechanical way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the last,&#8221; he said; &#8220;she had no fear and suffered
no pain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little woman watched him with tender, wistful eyes;
two large tears welled up and slipped down her cheeks, but
she smiled softly as they fell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She had so wanted to go to Italy,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and was
so happy to be there. And at the last it was such a lovely
day, and she enjoyed it so and was propped up on a sofa
near the window, and looked out at the blue sky and the
mountains, and made a little sketch. Tell him, Lucien,&#8221;
and she touched his arm again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to hear,&#8221; said Baird, &#8220;but you must
not tire yourself by standing,&#8221; and he took her hand gently
and led her to a chair and sat down beside her, still holding
her hand.
</p>
<p>But Latimer remained standing, resting his elbow upon
the mantel and looking down at the floor as he spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was not well in England,&#8221; the little mother put
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
in, &#8220;but in Italy he thought she was better even to the
very last.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was weak,&#8221; Latimer went on, without raising his
eyes, &#8220;but she was always bright and&mdash;and happy. She
used to lie on the sofa by the window and look out and
try to make sketches. She could see the Apennines, and it
was the chestnut harvest and the peasants used to pass
along the road on their way to the forests, and she liked to
watch them. She used to try to sketch them too, but she
was too weak; and when I wrote home for her, she made
me describe them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In her bright way!&#8221; said his mother. &#8220;I read the letters
over and over again and they seemed like pictures&mdash;like
her little pictures. It scarcely seems as if Lucien
could have written them at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The last day,&#8221; said Latimer, &#8220;I had written home to
say that she was better. She was so well in the morning
that she talked of trying to take a drive, but in the afternoon
she was a little tired&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But only a little,&#8221; interrupted the mother eagerly,
&#8220;and quite happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a little&mdash;and quite happy,&#8221; said Latimer. &#8220;There
was a beautiful sunset and I drew her sofa to the windows
and she lay and looked at it&mdash;and talked; and just as the
sun went down&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All in a lovely golden glory, as if the gates of heaven
were open,&#8221; the gentle voice added.
</p>
<p>Latimer paused for an instant. His sallow face had become
paler. He drew out his handkerchief and touched
his forehead with it and his lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All in a glow of gold,&#8221; he went on a little more hoarsely,
&#8220;just as it went down, she turned on her pillow and began
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
to speak to me. She said &#8216;How beautiful it all is, and how
glad&mdash;,&#8217; and her voice died away. I thought she was
looking at the sky again. She had lifted her eyes to it and
was smiling: the smile was on her face when I&mdash;bent over
her&mdash;a few moments after&mdash;and found that all was over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not like death at all,&#8221; said his mother with a
soft breathlessness. &#8220;She never even knew.&#8221; And though
tears streamed down her cheeks, she smiled.
</p>
<p>Baird rose suddenly and went to Latimer&#8217;s side. He wore
the pale and bewildered face of a man walking in a dream.
He laid his hand on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it was not like death,&#8221; he said; &#8220;try and remember
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do remember it,&#8221; was the answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She escaped both death and life,&#8221; said John Baird,
&#8220;both death and life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little mother sat wiping her eyes gently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all so bright to her,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can scarcely
think of it as a grief that we have lost her&mdash;for a little
while. Her little room upstairs never seems empty. I
could fancy that she might come in at any moment smiling
as she used to. If she had ever suffered or been sad in it,
I might feel as if the pain and sadness were left there; but
when I open the door it seems as if her pretty smile met me,
or the sound of her voice singing as she used to when she
painted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She rose and went to her son&#8217;s side again, laying her
hand on his arm with a world of tenderness in her touch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to think of that, Lucien, dear,&#8221; she said; &#8220;try to
think that her face was never any sadder or older than we
see it in her pretty picture there. She might have lived to
be tired of living, and she was saved from it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Try to help him,&#8221; she said, turning to Baird, &#8220;perhaps
you can. He has not learned to bear it yet. They were
very near to each other, and perhaps he is too young to
think of it as we do. Grief is always heavier to young
people, I think. Try to help him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She went out of the room quietly, leaving them together.
</p>
<p>When she was gone, John Baird found himself trying,
with a helpless feeling of desperation, to spur himself up
to saying something; but neither words nor thoughts would
come. For the moment his mind seemed a perfect blank,
and the silence of the room was terrible.
</p>
<p>It was Latimer who spoke first, stiffly, and as if with
difficulty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be more resigned,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I should be
resigned. But it has been a heavy blow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird moistened his dry lips but found no words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She had a bright nature,&#8221; the lagging voice went on,
&#8220;a bright nature&mdash;and gifts&mdash;which I had not. God gave
me no gifts, and it is natural to me to see that life is dark
and that I can only do poorly the work which falls to me.
I was a gloomy, unhappy boy when she was born. I had
learned to know the lack in myself early, and I saw in her
what I longed for. I know the feeling is a sin against God
and that His judgment will fall upon me&mdash;but I have no
power against it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very natural feeling,&#8221; said Baird, hoarsely. &#8220;We
cannot resign ourselves at once under a great sorrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A just God who punishes rebellion demands it of His
servants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that!&#8221; Baird interrupted, with a shudder;
&#8220;we need a God of Mercy, not a God who condemns.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Need!&#8221; the dark face almost livid in its pallor, &#8220;<i>We</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
need! It is not He who was made for our needs, but we for
His. For His servants there is only submission to the
anguish chosen for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a harsh creed,&#8221; said Baird, &#8220;and a dark one.
Try a brighter one, man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no brighter one for me,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;She had a brighter one, poor child&mdash;and mine was a heavy
trouble to her. Why should we deceive ourselves? What
are we in His sight&mdash;in the sight of Immutable, Eternal
God? We can only do His will and await the end. We
have reason which we may not use; we can only believe and
suffer. There is agony on every side of us which, if it were
His will, He might relieve, but does not. It is His will,
and what is the impotent rebellion of Nature against that?
What help have we against Him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His harsh voice had risen until it was almost a cry,
the lank locks which fell over his sallow forehead were
damp with sweat. He put them back with a desperate
gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Such words of themselves are sin,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and it is
my curse and punishment that I should bear in my breast
every hour the crime of such rebellion. What is there left
for me? Is there any labour or any pang borne for others
that will wipe out the stain from my soul?&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Baird looked at him as he had looked before. His
usual ready flow of speech, his rapidity of thought, his
knowledge of men and their necessities seemed all to have
deserted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;&#8221; he stammered, &#8220;I am not&mdash;fit&mdash;not fit&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had not known what he was going to say when he
began, and he did not know how he intended to end. He
heard with a passionate sense of relief that the door behind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
them opened, and turned to find that Mrs. Latimer stood
upon the threshold as if in hesitancy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucien,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is that poor girl from Janway&#8217;s
Mills. The one Margery was so sorry for&mdash;Susan Chapman.
She wants to see you. I think the poor child wants
to ask about Margery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer made a movement forward, but checked himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her to come in,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Latimer went to the front door, and in a few seconds
returned. The girl was with her and entered the room
slowly. She was very pale and her eyes were dilated and
she breathed fast as if frightened. She glanced at John
Baird and stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know anyone else was here,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go away, if you wish it,&#8221; said Baird, the sympathetic
tone returning to his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Latimer, &#8220;you can do her more good than I
can. This gentleman,&#8221; he added to the girl, &#8220;is my friend,
and a Minister of God as well as myself. He is the Rev.
John Baird.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was in his eyes, as he addressed her, a look which
was like an expression of dread&mdash;as if he saw in her young
yet faded face and figure something which repelled him
almost beyond self-control.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the girl saw, while she did not comprehend it.
She regarded him helplessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;hardly&mdash;why I came,&#8221; she faltered,
twisting the corner of her shawl.
</p>
<p>She had been rather pretty, but the colour and freshness
were gone from her face and there were premature lines of
pain and misery marking it here and there.
</p>
<p>Baird moved a chair near her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Have you walked all the way
from Janway&#8217;s Mills?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She started a little and gave him a look, half wonder, half
relief, and then fell to twisting the fringe of her poor shawl
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I walked,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;but I can&#8217;t set down.
I h&#8217;ain&#8217;t but a minute to stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her clothes, which had been shabby at their best, were
at their worst now, and, altogether, she was a figure neither
attractive nor picturesque.
</p>
<p>But Baird saw pathos in her. It was said that one of
his most charming qualities was his readiness to discover
the pathetic under any guise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You came to ask Mr. Latimer some questions, perhaps?&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>She suddenly burst into tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t help it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She checked herself and wiped her tears away with the
shawl corner almost immediately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to know something about <i>her</i>,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Nobody seemed to know nothin&#8217;, only that she was dead.
When they said you&#8217;d come home, it seemed like I couldn&#8217;t
rest until I&#8217;d heard something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to hear?&#8221; said Latimer.
</p>
<p>It struck Baird that the girl&#8217;s manner was a curious one.
It was a manner which seemed to conceal beneath its shamefaced
awkwardness some secret fear or anxiety. She gave
Latimer a hurried, stealthy look, and then her eyes fell.
It was as if she would have read in his gloomy face what
she did not dare to ask.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be afraid to die myself,&#8221; she stammered. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
bear to think of it. I&#8217;m afraid. Was she?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Latimer answered.
</p>
<p>The girl gave him another dull, stealthy look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; she said; &#8220;she can&#8217;t have minded
so much if she wasn&#8217;t afraid. I&#8217;d like to think she didn&#8217;t
mind it so much&mdash;or suffer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not suffer,&#8221; said Latimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw nothin&#8217; of her after the last day she came
to Janway&#8217;s Mills,&#8221; the girl began.
</p>
<p>Latimer lifted his eyes suddenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She went to the Mills?&#8221; he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, her voice shaking. &#8220;I guess she
never told. After that first night she stood by me. No
one else did. Seemed like other folks thought I&#8217;d poison
&#8217;em. She&#8217;d come an&#8217; see me an&#8217;&mdash;help me. She was sick
the last day she came, and when she was going home she
fainted in the street, I heard folks say, I never saw her after
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She brushed a tear from her face with the shawl again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So as she didn&#8217;t mind much, or suffer,&#8221; she said, &#8220;t&#8217;ain&#8217;t
so bad to think of. She wasn&#8217;t one to be able to stand up
against things. She&#8217;d have died if she&#8217;d been me. I&#8217;d be
glad enough to die myself, if I wasn&#8217;t afraid. She&#8217;d cry
over me when I wasn&#8217;t crying over myself. I&#8217;ve been beat
about till I don&#8217;t mind, like I used. They&#8217;re a hard lot
down at the Mills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; said Latimer, &#8220;what sort of a life have you
been leading?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His voice was harsh and his manner repellant only because
Nature had served him the cruel turn of making
them so. He was bitterly conscious as he spoke of having
chosen the wrong words and uttered them with an appearance
of relentless rigour which he would have made
any effort to soften.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>Baird made a quick movement towards the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any work?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Do you need help?
Don&#8217;t mind telling us. My friend is to take charge of your
church at the Mills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl interrupted him. She had turned miserably
pale under Latimer&#8217;s question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no church of mine!&#8221; she said, passionately; &#8220;I
h&#8217;ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to do with it. I never belonged to no church
anyhow, an&#8217; I&#8217;m leadin&#8217; the kind o&#8217; life any girl&#8217;d lead
that hadn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; nor nobody. I don&#8217;t mean,&#8221; with a
strangled sob, &#8220;to even myself with <i>her</i>; but what&#8217;ud she
ha&#8217; done if she&#8217;d ha&#8217; slipped like I did&mdash;an&#8217; then had
nothin&#8217; nor&mdash;nor nobody?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of her!&#8221; cried Latimer, almost fiercely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twon&#8217;t hurt her,&#8221; said the girl, struggling with a sob
again; &#8220;she&#8217;s past bein&#8217; hurt even by such as me&mdash;an&#8217; I&#8217;m
glad of it. She&#8217;s well out of it all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned as if she would have gone away, but Baird
checked her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; he said; &#8220;perhaps I can be of some
service to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do nothin&#8217;,&#8221; she interrupted. &#8220;Nobody
can&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me try,&#8221; he said; &#8220;take a note to Miss Starkweather
from me and wait at the house for a few minutes. Come,
that isn&#8217;t much, is it? You&#8217;ll do that much, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked down at the floor a few seconds and then up
at him. It had always been considered one of his recommendations
that he was so unprofessional in his appearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, slowly, &#8220;I can do that, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew a note-book from his breast-pocket and, having
written a few words on a leaf of it, tore it out and
handed it to her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Take that to Miss Starkweather&#8217;s house and say I sent
you with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she was gone, he turned to Latimer again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I go,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to say a few words to
you&mdash;to ask you to make me a promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the promise?&#8221; said Latimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is that we shall be friends&mdash;friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird laid his hand on the man&#8217;s gaunt shoulder with a
nervous grasp as he spoke, and his voice was unsteady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never had a friend,&#8221; answered Latimer, monotonously;
&#8220;I should scarcely know what to do with one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is time you had one,&#8221; Baird replied. &#8220;And
I may have something to offer you. There may be something
in&mdash;in my feeling which may be worth your having.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held out his hand.
</p>
<p>Latimer looked at it for a second, then at him, his sallow
face flushing darkly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are offering me a good deal,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I scarcely
know why&mdash;myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t take my hand, Latimer,&#8221; Baird said;
and the words were spoken with a faint loss of colour.
</p>
<p>Latimer took it, flushing more darkly still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I to offer in return?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have
nothing. You had better think again. I should only be
a kind of shadow on your life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want nothing in return&mdash;nothing,&#8221; Baird said. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t even ask feeling from you. Be a shadow on my life,
if you will. Why should I have no shadows? Why should
all go smoothly with me, while others&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He paused,
checking his vehemence as if he had suddenly recognised
it. &#8220;Let us be friends,&#8221; he said.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p>The respectable portion of the population of Janway&#8217;s
Mills believed in church-going and on Sunday-school attendance&mdash;in
fact, the most entirely respectable believed
that such persons as neglected these duties were preparing
themselves for damnation. They were a quiet, simple, and
unintellectual people. Such of them as occasionally read
books knew nothing of any literature which was not religious.
The stories they had followed through certain
inexpensive periodicals were of the order which describes
the gradual elevation of the worldly-minded or depraved
to the plane of church-going and Sunday-school. Their
few novels made it their <i>motif</i> to prove that it is easier for
a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Any hero or
heroine of wealth who found peace of mind and married
happily, only attained these objects through the assistance
of some noble though humble unsecular person whose example
and instruction led them to adopt unsecular views.
The point of view of Janway&#8217;s Mills was narrow and far
from charitable when it was respectable; its point of view,
when it was not respectable, was desperate. Even sinners,
at Janway&#8217;s Mills, were primitive and limited in outlook.
They did not excuse themselves with specious argument
for their crimes of neglecting church-going, using bad language,
hanging about bar-rooms, and loose living. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
were not brilliant wrongdoers and made no attempt at defending
themselves or pretending that they did not know
they were going to perdition. The New England mind is
not broad or versatile, and, having begun life in a Puritan
atmosphere, it is not quick to escape its influence. Society
at the Mills recognised no social distinction which
was not founded upon the respectability of church-going
and the observance of social laws made by church-goers;
it recognised none because it absolutely <i>knew</i> of none. The
great world was not far from Janway&#8217;s Mills, but they did
not touch each other. Willowfield was near, Boston and
New York themselves were not far distant, but the curious
fact being that millions of human minds may work and
grow and struggle as if they were the minds of dwellers
upon another planet, though less than a hundred miles
may separate them, the actual lives, principles, and significances
of the larger places did not seem to touch the smaller
one. The smaller one was a village of a few streets of small
houses which had grown up about the Mills themselves.
The Mills gave employment to a village full of hands, so the
village gradually evolved itself. It was populated by the
uneducated labouring class; some were respectable, some
were dissolute and lived low and gross lives, but all were
uneducated in any sense which implies more than the
power to read, write, and make a few necessary calculations.
Most of them took some newspaper. They read of
the multi-millionaires who lived in New York and Chicago
and California, they read of the politicians in Washington,
they found described to them the great entertainments
given by millionaires&#8217; wives and daughters, the marvellous
dresses they wore, the multifarious ways in which they
amused themselves, but what they read seemed so totally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
unlike anything they had ever seen, so far apart from their
own lives, that though they were not aware of the fact, the
truth was that they believed in them with about the same
degree of realisation with which they believed in what
they heard in the pulpit of the glories of the New Jerusalem.
No human being exists without an ambition, and
the ambition of Janway&#8217;s Millers of the high-class was to
possess a neat frame-house with clean Nottingham lace
curtains at the windows, fresh oilcloth on the floor of the
front hall, furniture covered with green or red reps in the
parlour, a tapestry Brussels carpet, and a few lithographs
upon the walls. It was also the desire of the owners of such
possessions that everyone should know that they attended
one of the churches, that their house-cleaning was done
regularly, that no member of the family frequented bar-rooms,
and that they were respectable people. It was an
ambition which was according to their lights, and could be
despised by no honest human being, however dull it might
appear to him. It resulted oftener than not in the making
of excellent narrow lives which brought harm to no one.
The lives which went wrong on the street-corners and in
the bar-rooms often did harm. They produced discomfort,
unhappiness, and disorder; but as it is also quite
certain that no human being produces these things without
working out his own punishment for himself while
he lives on earth, the ends of justice were doubtless attained.
</p>
<p>If a female creature at the Mills broke the great social
law, there was no leaning towards the weakness of pity for
her, Janway&#8217;s was not sufficiently developed, mentally, to
deal with gradations or analysis of causes and impelling
powers. The girl who brought forth a child without the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
pale of orthodox marriage was an outcast and a disgraced
creature, and nobody flinched from pronouncing her both.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s disgustin&#8217;, that&#8217;s what I call it,&#8221; it was the custom
for respectable wives and mothers to say. &#8220;It&#8217;s disgustin&#8217;!
A nice thing she&#8217;s done for herself. I h&#8217;ain&#8217;t no patience
with girls like her, with no fear o&#8217; God or religion in them
an&#8217; no modesty and decency. She deserves whatever comes
to her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Usually every tragedy befell her which could befall a
woman. If her child lived, it lived the life of wretchedness
and was an outcast also. The outcome of its existence was
determined by the order of woman its mother chanced to
be. If the maternal instinct was warm and strong within
her and she loved it, there were a few chances that it might
fight through its early years of struggle and expand into
a human being who counted as <i>one</i> at least among the
world&#8217;s millions. Usually the mother died in the gutter or
the hospital, but there had been women who survived, and
when they did so it was often because they made a battle for
their children. Sometimes it was because they were made
of the material which is not easily beaten, and then they
learned as the years went by that the human soul and will
may be even stronger than that which may seem at the
outset overwhelming fate.
</p>
<p>When the girl Susan Chapman fell into misfortune and
disgrace, her path was not made easy for her. There were
a few months when the young mill hand who brought
disaster upon her, made love to her, and hung about her
small home, sometimes leaning upon the rickety gate to
talk and laugh with her, sometimes loitering with her in
the streets or taking her to cheap picnics or on rather
rowdy excursions. She wore the excited and highly pleased
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
air seen in young women of her class when the masculine
creature is paying court. She spent her wages in personal
decoration, she bought cheap feathers and artificial flowers
and remnants on &#8220;bargain days,&#8221; and decked herself with
them. Her cheap, good looks reached their highest point
because she felt the glow of a promotive triumph and her
spirits were exhilarated. She was nearer happiness than
she had ever been before. The other girls, who were mill
hands like herself, were full of the usual rather envious
jokes about her possible marriage. To be married was to
achieve a desirable distinction and to work at home instead
of at the Mills. The young man was not an absolute
villain, he was merely an ignorant, foolish young animal.
At first he had had inchoate beliefs in a domestic
future with the girl. But the time came when equally inchoate
ideas of his own manhood led him to grow cool.
The New England atmosphere which had not influenced
him in all points, influenced him in the matter of feeling
that the woman a man married must have kept herself respectable.
The fact that he himself had caused her fall
from the plane of decency was of comparatively small moment.
</p>
<p>A man who married a woman who had not managed to
keep straight, put himself into a sort of ridiculous position.
He lost masculine distinction. This one ceased
to lean on the gate and talk at night, and went to fewer
picnics. He was in less high spirits, and so was the girl.
She often looked pale and as if she had been crying. Then
Jack Williams gave up his place at the Mill and left the
village. He did not tell his sweetheart. The morning after
he left, Susan came to her work and found the girls about
her wearing a mysterious and interested air.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are you whispering about?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the secret?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no secret,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Most everybody&#8217;s
heard it, and I guess it ain&#8217;t no secret to you. I guess he
told you when he made up his mind to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack Williams. He&#8217;s gone out to Chicago to work
somewhere there. He kept it pretty dark from us, but
when he went off on the late train last night, Joe Evans
saw him, and he said he&#8217;d had the offer of a first-rate job
and was going to it. How you stare, Sue! Your eyes look
as if they&#8217;d pop out o&#8217; yer head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was staring and her skin had turned blue-white.
She broke into a short hysteric laugh and fell down. Then
she was very sick and fainted and had to be taken home
trembling so that she could scarcely crawl as she walked,
with great tears dropping down her cold face. Janway&#8217;s
Mills knew well enough after this that Jack Williams had
deserted her, and had no hesitation in suggesting a reason
for his defection.
</p>
<p>The months which followed were filled with the torments
of a squalid Inferno. Girls who had regarded her with
envy, began to refuse to speak to her or to be seen in her
company. Jack Williams&#8217;s companions were either impudent
or disdainful, the married women stared at her and
commented on her as she passed; there were no more picnics
or excursions for her; her feathers became draggled
and hung broken in her hat. She had no relatives in the
village, having come from a country place. She was thankful
that she had not a family of aunts on the spot, because
she knew they would have despised her and talked her over
more than the rest. She lived in a bare little room which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
she rented from a poor couple, and she used to sit alone
in it, huddled up in a heap by the window, crying for
hours in the evening as she watched the other girls go by
laughing and joking with their sweethearts.
</p>
<p>One night when there was a sociable in the little frame
Methodist church opposite, and she saw it lighted up and
the people going in dressed in their best clothes and excited
at meeting each other, the girls giggling at the sight of
their favourite young men&mdash;just as she had giggled six
months before&mdash;her slow tears began to drip faster and
the sobs came one upon another until she was choked by
them and she began to make a noise. She sobbed and cried
more convulsively, until she began to scream and went into
something like hysterics. She dropped down on her face
and rolled over and over, clutching at her breast and her
sides and throwing out her arms. The people of the house
had gone to the sociable and she was alone, so no one heard
or came near her. She shrieked and sobbed and rolled over
and over, clutching at her flesh, trying to gasp out words
that choked her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O, Lord!&#8221; she gasped, wild with the insensate agony
of a poor, hysteria torn, untaught, uncontrolled thing, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ve done! I don&#8217;t! &#8217;Tain&#8217;t fair! I didn&#8217;t
go to! I can&#8217;t bear it! He h&#8217;ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; to bear, he
ain&#8217;t! O, Lord God, look down on me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was the poor, helpless outcome of the commonest
phase of life, but her garret saw a ghastly tragedy as she
choked through her hysterics. Who is to blame for and
who to prevent such tragedies, let deep thinkers strive to
tell.
</p>
<p>The day after this was the one on which little Margery
Latimer came into her life. It was in the early spring, just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
before the child had gone to Boston to begin her art lessons.
She had come to Janway&#8217;s Mills to see a poor woman who
had worked for her mother. The woman lived in the
house in which Susan had her bare room. She began to
talk about the girl half fretfully, half contemptuously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the one Jack Williams got into trouble and then
left to get out of it by herself as well as she could,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;She might ha&#8217; known it. Gals is fools. She can&#8217;t
work at the Mills any more, an&#8217; last night when we was
all at the Sosherble, she seems to&#8217;ve had a spasm o&#8217; some
kind; she can&#8217;t get out o&#8217; bed this mornin&#8217; and lies there
lookin&#8217; like death an&#8217; moanin&#8217;. I can&#8217;t &#8217;tend to her, I&#8217;ve
got work o&#8217; my own to do. Lansy! how she was moanin&#8217;
when I passed her door! Seemed like she&#8217;d kill herself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, poor thing!&#8221; cried Margery; &#8220;let me go up to
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was a sensitive creature, and the colour had ebbed
out of her pretty face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lor, no!&#8221; the woman cried; &#8220;she ain&#8217;t the kind o&#8217; gal
you&#8217;d oughter be doing things for, she was allus right down
common, an&#8217; she&#8217;s sunk down &#8217;bout as low as a gal can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Margery went up to the room where the moaning
was going on. She stood outside the door on the landing
for a few moments, her heart trembling in her side before
she went in. Her life had been a simple, happy, bright one
up to this time. She had not seen the monster life close
at hand. She had large, childish eyes which were the
colour of harebells and exquisitely sympathetic and sweet.
There were tears in them when she gently opened the door
and stood timidly on the threshold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me, please let me come in,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say
I mayn&#8217;t.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>The moaning and low choking sobs went on, and in a
very few moments they so wrought upon her, that she
pushed the door farther open and entered the room. What
she saw was a barren, common little place, and on the bed
a girl lying utterly prostrated by an hysteric tempest which
had lasted hours. Her face was white and swollen and
covered with red marks, as if she had clutched and torn it
with her fingers, her dress was torn open at the bosom, and
her hair tumbled, torn, and loose about the pillow; there
was a discoloured place upon her forehead which was settling
into a bruise. Her eyes were puffed with crying until
they were almost closed. Her breast rose with short, exhausted,
but still convulsive sobs. Margery felt as if she
was drawn into a vortex of agony. She could not resist it.
She went to the bed, stood still a second, trembling, and
then sank upon her knees and put her face down upon the
wretched hand nearest and kissed it with piteous impulsive
sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! don&#8217;t cry like that,&#8221; she said, crying herself. &#8220;Oh,
don&#8217;t! Oh, don&#8217;t! I&#8217;m so sorry for you&mdash;I&#8217;m <i>so</i> sorry for
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She did not know the girl at all, she had never even heard
of her before, but she kissed her hand and cried over it and
fondled it against her breast. She was one of those human
things created by Nature to suffer with others, and for
them, and through them.
</p>
<p>She did not know how long it was before the girl became
sufficiently, articulate to speak to her. She herself was
scarcely articulate for some time. She could only try to
find words to meet a need so far beyond her ken. She had
never come in contact with a woman in this strait before.
</p>
<p>But at last Susan was lying in the bed instead of on its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
tossed and tumbled outside. Margery had done the nearest,
simple things for her. She had helped her to bathe
her face with cold water, to undress and put on her nightgown;
she had prepared her narrow bed for her decently,
and smoothed and wound up her hair. Then she had gone
downstairs, got her a cup of tea, and sat by her and made
her drink it. Then she set the room in order and opened
the window to air it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a bruise on your forehead,&#8221; she had said, as
she was arranging the torn hair. &#8220;You must have struck
it against something when you were ill last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I struck it against the wall,&#8221; Susan answered, in a
monotonous voice. &#8220;I did it on purpose. I banged my
head against the wall until I fell down and was sick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Margery&#8217;s face quivered again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think about it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You ought not to
have been alone. Some&mdash;some friend ought to have been
with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got any friends,&#8221; Susan answered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know why you came up to me. I don&#8217;t guess you know
what&#8217;s the matter with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; said Margery. &#8220;You are in great trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the worst kind o&#8217; trouble a woman can get into,&#8221;
said Susan, the muscles of her face beginning to be drawn
again. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why&mdash;why Jack Williams can skip off
to Chicago to a new, big job that&#8217;s a stroke o&#8217; luck&mdash;an&#8217; me
left lie here to bear everything&mdash;an&#8217; be picked at, an&#8217; made
fun of, an&#8217; druv mad with the way I&#8217;m kicked in the gutter.
I don&#8217;t see no <i>right</i> in it. There <i>ain&#8217;t</i> no right in it; I don&#8217;t
believe there&#8217;s no God anyhow; I won&#8217;t never believe it
again. No one can&#8217;t make me. If I&#8217;ve done what gives
folks a right to cast me off, so&#8217;s Jack Williams.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t pretended to love a person and then run
away and left them to&mdash;to suffer,&#8221; said little Margery, on
the verge of sobs again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t!&#8221; said the girl, her tears beginning to
stream anew. &#8220;I&#8217;m not your kind. I&#8217;m not educated. I&#8217;m
only a common mill hand, but I did love Jack Williams
all I knew how. He had such a nice way with him&mdash;kind
of affectionate, an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; he was real good-lookin&#8217; too when
he was fixed up. If I&#8217;d been married to him, no one would
have said nothin&#8217;, an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; &#8217;tain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but a minister
readin&#8217; somethin&#8217; anyhow&mdash;marryin&#8217; ain&#8217;t.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p>This was before Margery went to Boston to try to develop
her gift for making pretty sketches. Her father and mother
and her brother strained every nerve to earn and save the
money to cover her expenses. She went away full of innocent,
joyous hope in the month of May. She boarded in
a plain, quiet house, and had two rooms. One was her workroom
and studio. She worked under a good-natured artist,
who thought her a rather gifted little creature and used to
take her to look at any pictures that were on exhibition.
Taking into consideration her youth and limited advantages,
she made such progress as led him to say that she had a
future before her.
</p>
<p>She had never deserted Sue Chapman after that first morning
in which she had gone to her rescue. Janway&#8217;s Mills
was bewildered when it found that the Reverend Lucien
Latimer&#8217;s sister went to see Jack Williams&#8217; deserted sweetheart,
and did not disdain to befriend her in her disgrace.
The church-going element, with the Nottingham lace curtains
in its parlour windows, would have been shocked, but
that it was admitted that &#8220;the Latimers has always been
a well-thought-of family, an&#8217; all of &#8217;em is members in good
standin&#8217;. They&#8217;re greatly respected in Willowfield; even
the old fam&#8217;lies speak to &#8217;em when they meet &#8217;em in the
street or at Church.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I&#8217;d be willin&#8217; for my Elma Ann to &#8217;sociate
with a girl that&#8217;s gone wrong. Maybe it&#8217;s sorter different
with a minister&#8217;s sister. Ministers&#8217; families has to &#8217;sociate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
out o&#8217; charity an&#8217; religion; go to pray with &#8217;em, an&#8217; that,
an&#8217; read the Scripture to make &#8217;em sense their sinfulness
an&#8217; the danger they&#8217;re in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Margery did not pray with Susan Chapman, or read
the Bible to her. The girl held obstinately to her statement
of unbelief in a God, and Margery did not feel that her mood
was one to which reading the Gospel would appeal. If she
could have explained to her the justice of the difference between
Jack Williams&#8217; lot and her own, she felt they might
have advanced perhaps, but she could not. She used to go
to see her and try to alleviate her physical discomfort and
miserable poverty. She saved her from hunger and cold
when she could no longer work at all, and she taught her
to feel that she was not utterly without a friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;d have done without you, God knows&mdash;or what
ought to be God,&#8221; Sue said. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t care, but you did.
If there <i>is</i> one, He&#8217;s got a lot to learn from some of the
people He&#8217;s made Himself. &#8216;After His own image created
He them&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s what the Bible says; but I don&#8217;t believe
it. If He was as good and kind-hearted as the best of us,
He wouldn&#8217;t sit upon His throne with angels singing round
an&#8217; playin&#8217; on harps, an&#8217; Him too much interested to see
how everything sufferin&#8217; down below. What did He make
us for, if He couldn&#8217;t look after us? I wouldn&#8217;t make a
thing I wouldn&#8217;t do my best by&mdash;an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but
a factory girl. This&mdash;this poor thing that&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be born
an&#8217; hain&#8217;t no right to, I&#8217;ll do my level best by it&mdash;I will.
It sha&#8216;n&#8217;t suffer, if I can help it&#8221;&mdash;her lips jerking.
</p>
<p>Sometimes Margery would talk to her a little about Jack
Williams&mdash;or, rather, she would listen while Susan talked.
Then Susan would cry, large, slow-rolling tears slipping
down her cheeks.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how&mdash;how it happened like this,&#8221; she
would say. &#8220;It seems like a kind o&#8217; awful dream. I don&#8217;t
know nothin&#8217;. He was common&mdash;just like I am&mdash;an&#8217; he
didn&#8217;t know much; but it didn&#8217;t seem like he was a bad
feller&mdash;an&#8217; I do b&#8217;lieve he liked me. <i>Seemed</i> like he did,
anyways. They say he&#8217;s got a splendid job in Chicago. He
won&#8217;t never know nothin&#8217; about what happens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Margery did not leave her unprovided for when she went
to Boston. It cost very little to keep her for a few months
in her small room. The people of the house promised to be
decently kind to her. Margery had only been away from
home two weeks when the child was born. The hysterical
paroxysms and violent outbreaks of grief its mother had
passed through, her convulsive writhings and clutchings and
beating of her head against the walls had distorted and exhausted
the little creature. The women who were with her
said its body looked as if it were bruised in spots all over,
and there was a purple mark on its temple. It breathed
a few times and died.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good thing, too!&#8221; said the women. &#8220;There&#8217;s too many
in the world that&#8217;s got a right here. It&#8217;d hev&#8217; had to go
to ruin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good thing for <i>it</i>,&#8221; said Susan, weakly but sullenly,
from her bed; &#8220;but if it&#8217;s God as makes &#8217;em, how did He
come to go to the trouble of making this one an&#8217; sendin&#8217;
it out, if it hadn&#8217;t no right to come? He <i>does</i> make &#8217;em
all, doesn&#8217;t he? You wouldn&#8217;t darst to say He didn&#8217;t&mdash;you,
Mrs. Hopp, that&#8217;s a church member!&#8221; And her white face
actually drew itself into a ghastly, dreary grin. &#8220;Lawsy!
He&#8217;s kept pretty busy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she was able to stand on her feet she went back to
the mill. She was a good worker, and hands were needed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
The girls and women fought shy of her, and she had no
chance of enjoying any young pleasures or comforts, even
if she had not been too much broken on the rack of the
misery of the last year to have energy to desire them. No
young man wanted to be seen talking to her, no young
woman cared to walk with her in the streets. She always
went home to her room alone, and sat alone, and thought
of what had happened to her, trying to explain to herself
how it had happened and why it had turned out that she
was worse than any other girl. She had never felt like a
bad girl. No one had ever called her one before this last
year.
</p>
<p>Three months after the child was born and died, Margery
came back to Willowfield to spend a week at home. She
came to see Susan, and they sat together in the tragic little
bare room and talked. Though the girl had been so delicately
pretty before she left home, Susan saw that she had
become much prettier. She was dressed in light, softly
tinted summer stuffs, and there was something about her
which was curiously flower-like. Her long-lashed, harebell
blue eyes seemed to have widened and grown lovelier in their
innocent look. A more subtle mind than Susan Chapman&#8217;s
might have said that she seemed to be looking farther into
Life&#8217;s spaces, and that she was trembling upon the verge
of something unknown and beautiful.
</p>
<p>She talked about Boston and the happiness of her life
there, and of her work and her guileless girlish hopes and
ambitions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am doing my very best,&#8221; she said, a spot of pink flickering
on her cheek; &#8220;I work as hard as I can, but you see
I am so ignorant. I could not have learned anything about
art in Willowfield. But people are so good to me&mdash;people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
who know a great deal. There is one gentleman who comes
sometimes to see Mr. Barnard at the studio. He is so wonderful,
it seems to me. He has travelled, and knows all
about the great galleries and the pictures in them. He
talks so beautifully that everyone listens when he comes in.
Nobody can bear to go on with work for fear of missing
something. You would think he would not notice a plain
little Willowfield girl, but he has been <i>lovely</i> to me, Susan.
He has even looked at my work and criticised it for me,
and talked to me. He nearly always talks to me a little when
he comes in, and once I met him in the Gardens, and he
stopped and talked there, and walked about looking at the
flowers with me. They had been planting out the spring
things, and it was like being in fairyland to walk about
among them and hear the things he said about pictures. It
taught me so much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She referred to this friend two or three times, and once
mentioned his name, but Susan forgot it. She was such
a beautiful, happy little thing, and seemed so exquisite an
expression of spring-like, radiant youth and its innocent joy
in living that the desolate and stranded creature she had
befriended could think of nothing but her own awkward
worship and the fascination of the flower-like charm. She
used to sit and stare at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems so queer to see anyone as happy an&#8217; pretty as
you,&#8221; she broke out once. &#8220;Oh, Lawsy, I hope nothing
won&#8217;t ever come to spoil it. It hadn&#8217;t ought to be spoiled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A month or so later Margery paid a visit to her home
again. She stayed a longer time, but Susan only saw her
once. She had come home from Boston with a cold and
had been put to bed for a day or two.
</p>
<p>One morning Susan was in Willowfield and met her walking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
in a quiet street. She was walking slowly and looking
down as she went, as if some thought was abstracting her.
When Susan stopped before her, she looked up with a start.
It was a start which revealed that she had been brought back
suddenly from a distance, as it were a great distance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Susan!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, Susan!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She held out her hand in her pretty, affectionate way, but
she was actually a little out of breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I came on you so sudden,&#8221; Susan said, &#8220;I
startled you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I was&mdash;I was thinking of things
that seem so far off. When I&#8217;m in Willowfield it seems as
if&mdash;as if they can&#8217;t be true. Does anything ever seem like
that to you, Susan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Susan. One of her hopeless looks leaped
into her eyes. She did not say what the things were, but
she stared at Margery in a helpless, vacant way for a
moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you well, Susan, and have you got work?&#8221; asked
Margery. &#8220;I am coming to see you to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They spoke of common things for a few minutes, and
then went their separate ways.
</p>
<p>Why it was that when she paid the promised visit the
next day and they sat together in their old way and talked,
Susan felt a kind of misery creeping slowly upon her, she
could not in the least have explained. She was not sufficiently
developed mentally to have been capable of saying
to herself that there was a difference between this visit and
the last, between this Margery and the one who had sat with
her before. Her dull thoughts were too slow to travel to
a point so definite in so short a length of time as one afternoon
afforded.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your cold was a pretty bad one, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she asked,
vaguely, once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;It made me feel weak. But
it has gone now. I am quite well again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After that Susan saw her but once again. As time went
on she heard a vague rumour that the Latimers were anxious
about Margery&#8217;s health. Just at that time the mill hands
gossiped a good deal about Willowfield, because the Reverend
John Baird was said to be going to Europe. That led
to talk on the subject of other Willowfield people, and the
Latimers among them. In the rare, brief letters Margery
wrote to her <i>protégée</i>, she did not say she was ill. Once she
said her brother Lucien had quite suddenly come to Boston
to see how she was, because her mother imagined she must
have taken cold.
</p>
<p>She had been in Boston about a year then. One afternoon
Susan was in her room, standing by her bed forlornly, and,
in a vacant, reasonless mood, turning over the few coarse
little garments she had been able to prepare for her child&mdash;a
few common little shirts and nightgowns and gray flannels&mdash;no
more. She heard someone at the door. The handle
turned and the door opened as if the person who came in had
forgotten the ceremony of knocking. Susan laid down on
the bed the ugly little night-dress she had been looking at;
it lay there stiff with its coarseness, its short arms stretched
out. She turned about and faced Margery Latimer, who
had crossed the threshold and stood before her.
</p>
<p>Susan uttered a low, frightened cry before she could speak
a word.
</p>
<p>The girl looked like a ghost. It was a ghost Susan
thought of this time, and not a flower. The pure little face
was white and drawn, the features were sharpened, the harebell-coloured
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
eyes had almost a look of wildness; it was as
if they had been looking at something frightening for a
long time, until they could not lose the habit of expressing
fear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Susan,&#8221; she said, in a strange, uncertain voice, &#8220;you
didn&#8217;t expect to see me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Susan ran to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you was here. I
thought you was in Boston. What&#8217;s the matter? Oh, Lawsy,
Margery, what&#8217;s happened to make you look like this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody knows,&#8221; answered Margery. &#8220;They say it&#8217;s
the cold. They are frightened about me. I&#8217;m come to say
good-bye to you, Susan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sank into a chair and sat there, panting a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucien&#8217;s going to take me to Europe,&#8221; she said, her voice
all at once seeming to sound monotonous, as if she was reciting
a lesson mechanically. &#8220;I always wanted to go there&mdash;to
visit the picture galleries and study. They think the
climate will be good for me. I&#8217;ve been coughing in the
mornings&mdash;and I can&#8217;t eat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they think you might be going into&mdash;a consumption?&#8221;
Susan faltered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;s frightened,&#8221; said Margery. &#8220;She and the doctor
don&#8217;t know what to think. Lucien&#8217;s going to take me
to Europe. It&#8217;s expensive, but&mdash;but he has managed to
get the money. He sold a little farm he owned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good brother,&#8221; said Susan.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Margery began to cry as if she could not help it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;No one knows what a good
brother he is&mdash;nobody but myself. He is willing to give
up everything to&mdash;to save me&mdash;and to save poor mother
from awful trouble. Sometimes I think he is something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
like Christ&mdash;even like Christ! He is willing to suffer for
other people&mdash;for their pain&mdash;and weakness&mdash;and sin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was so evident that the change which had taken place
in her was a woeful one. Her bright loveliness was gone&mdash;her
simple, lovable happiness. Her nerves seemed all unstrung.
But it was the piteous, strained look in her childlike
eyes which stirred poor Susan&#8217;s breast to tumult.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery,&#8221; she said, almost trembling, &#8220;if&mdash;if&mdash;if you
was to go in a consumption and die&mdash;you&#8217;re not like me&mdash;you
needn&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next moment she was sorry she had said the crude
thing. Margery burst into a passion of weeping. Susan
flew to her and caught her in her arms, kneeling down by
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I oughtn&#8217;t to have said it,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You&#8217;re too ill
to be made to think of such things. I was a fool not to see&mdash;Margery,
Margery, don&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Margery was too weak to be able to control her sobbing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They say that&mdash;that God forgives people,&#8221; she wept.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve prayed and prayed to be forgiven for&mdash;for my sins.
I&#8217;ve never meant to be wicked. I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I don&#8217;t
know how&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Susan, soothing and patting her trembling
shoulder. &#8220;Hush, hush! If there <i>is</i> a God, Margery, He&#8217;s
a heap sight better than we give Him credit for. He don&#8217;t
make people a&#8217; purpose, so they can&#8217;t help things somehow&mdash;an&#8217;
don&#8217;t know&mdash;an&#8217; then send &#8217;em to burning hell for
<i>bein&#8217;</i> the way He made &#8217;em. <i>We</i> wouldn&#8217;t do it, an&#8217; He
won&#8217;t. You hain&#8217;t no reason to be afraid of dyin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Margery stayed with her about half an hour. There was
a curious element in their conversation. They spoke as if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
their interview was a final one. Neither of them actually
expressed the thought in words, but a listener would have
felt vaguely that they never expected to meet each other
again on earth. They made no references to the future; it
was as if no future could be counted upon. Afterwards,
when she was alone, Susan realised that she had never once
said &#8220;when you come back from Europe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As she was leaving the room, Margery passed the bed on
which the small, coarse garments lay. The little nightgown,
with its short sleeves stiffly outstretched, seemed to arrest her
attention specially. She caught at Susan&#8217;s dress as if she
was unaware that she made the movement or of the sharp
shudder which followed it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those&mdash;are its things, aren&#8217;t they, Susan?&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Susan answered, her sullen look of pain coming
back to her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t know&mdash;how people <i>bear</i> it!&#8221; exclaimed Margery.
It was an exclamation, and her hand went quickly
up to her mouth almost as if to press it back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t <i>bear</i> it,&#8221; said Susan, stonily. &#8220;They have
to go through it&mdash;that&#8217;s all. If you was standin&#8217; on the
gallows with the rope round your neck and the trap-door
under your feet, you wouldn&#8217;t be bearin&#8217; it, but the trap-door
would drop all the same, an&#8217; down you&#8217;d plunge&mdash;into
the blackness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was on this morning, on her way through the streets,
that Margery dropped in a dead faint upon the pavement,
and Miss Amory Starkweather, passing in her carriage,
picked her up and carried her home.
</p>
<p>Susan Chapman never saw her again. Some months afterwards
came the rumour that she had died of consumption
in Italy.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p>When, in accordance with Baird&#8217;s instructions, Susan
Chapman took the note to Miss Starkweather, she walked
through the tree-shaded streets, feeling as if she had suddenly
found herself in a foreign country. To the inhabitants
of Janway&#8217;s Mills, certain parts of Willowfield stood
for wealth, luxury, and decorous splendour. The Mills,
which lived within itself, was easily impressed. Its&mdash;occasionally
resentful&mdash;respect for Willowfield was enormous.
It did not behold it as a simple provincial town, whose business
establishments were primitive, and whose frame houses,
even when surrounded by square gardens with flower-beds
adorning them, were merely comfortable middle-class abodes
of domesticity. It was awed by the Willowfield <i>Times</i>, it
revered the button factory, and bitterly envied the carriages
driven and the occasional festivities held by the families of
the representatives of these monopolies. The carriages were
sober and middle-aged, and so were the parties, but to Janway&#8217;s
Mills they illustrated wealth and gaiety. People drove
about in the vehicles and wore fine clothes and ate cakes and
ice-cream at the parties&mdash;neither of which things had ever
been possible or ever would become possible to Janway&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>And Susan, who had been a Pariah and an outcast at the
Mills, was walking through the best streets, carrying a note
from the popular minister to the rich Miss Starkweather,
who had an entire square white frame house and garden,
which were her own property.
</p>
<p>The girl felt a little sullen and a little frightened. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
did not know what would happen to her; she did not know
how she would be expected to carry herself in a house so
representative of wealth and accustomedness to the good
things of life. Perhaps if she had not been desperate, and
also, if she had not known that Miss Starkweather had been
fond of Margery, she would have evaded going to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what she&#8217;ll say to me,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;They
say she&#8217;s queer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She still felt uncertain and resentful when she stood upon
the threshold and rang the bell. She presented a stolid
countenance to the maid servant who opened the door and
received her message. When she was at last taken to Miss
Amory, she went with an unresponding bearing, and, being
led into a cheerful room where the old woman sat, stood
before her waiting, as if she had really nothing to do with
the situation.
</p>
<p>Miss Amory looked rather like some alert old hawk, less
predatory by instinct than those of his species usually are.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are Susan Chapman, and come from Mr. Baird,&#8221;
she said.
</p>
<p>Susan nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He says he met you at Mr. Latimer&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I went there to ask something. I couldn&#8217;t bear
not to know&mdash;no more than I did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; asked Miss Amory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About Margery,&#8221; her voice lowering unconsciously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much did you know?&#8221; Miss Amory asked again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;,&#8221; rather sullenly, &#8220;but that she was ill&mdash;an&#8217;
went away an&#8217; died.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In Italy, they say,&#8221; put in Miss Amory&mdash;&#8220;lying on
a sofa before an open window&mdash;on a lovely day, when the
sun was setting.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>Susan Chapman started a little, and her face changed.
The unresponsiveness melted away. There was something
like a glow of relief in her look. She became human and
lost sight of Miss Amory&#8217;s supposed grandeur.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it like that?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Was it? I&#8217;m thankful
to you for telling me. Somehow I couldn&#8217;t ask properly
when I was face to face with her brother. You can&#8217;t talk
to him. I never knew where&mdash;or how&mdash;it was. I wanted
to find out if&mdash;if it was all right with her. I wanted to
know she hadn&#8217;t suffered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; Miss Amory answered. &#8220;And that was what
they told me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She passed her withered hand across her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was fond of her,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d <i>reason</i> to be,&#8221; returned Susan. &#8220;She was only a
delicate little young thing&mdash;but she came an&#8217; stayed by me
when I was in hell an&#8217; no one else would give me a drop
of water to cool my tongue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know something about that,&#8221; said Miss Amory; &#8220;I
have heard it talked of. Where&#8217;s your child?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Susan did not redden, but the hard look came back to
her face for a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t live but a few minutes,&#8221; she answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing for your living?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A faint red showed itself on the girl&#8217;s haggard cheeks,
and she stared at her with indifferent blankness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I worked in the mill till my health broke down for a
spell, an&#8217; I had to give up. I&#8217;m better now, but I&#8217;ve not
got a cent to live on, an&#8217; my place was filled up right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the man?&#8221; Miss Amory demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve never heard a word of him since
he slid off to Chicago.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Miss Amory.
</p>
<p>For a moment or so she sat silent, thinking. She held her
chin in her hand and pinched it. Presently she looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you come and live with me for a month?&#8221; she
enquired. &#8220;I believe we might try the experiment. I daresay
you would rub me when I want rubbing, and go errands
and help me up and down stairs and carry things for me.
It just happens that my old Jane has been obliged to leave
me because she&#8217;s beginning to be as rheumatic as I am
myself, and her daughter offers her a good home. Would
you like to try? I don&#8217;t promise to do more than make the
experiment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl flushed hot this time, as she looked down on
the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may guess whether I&#8217;m likely to say &#8216;yes&#8217; or not,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t had a crust to-day. I believe I could
<i>learn</i> to suit you. But I never expected anything as good
as this to happen to me. Thank you, ma&#8217;am. May I&mdash;when
must I come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take off your bonnet and go and have your dinner, and
stay now,&#8221; answered Miss Amory.
</p>
<p>When John Baird called later in the day, Miss Amory was
walking in the sun in her garden and Susan was with her,
supporting her stiff steps. She had been fed, her dress had
been changed for a neat print, and the dragged lines of her
face seemed already to have relaxed. She no longer wore
the look of a creature who is hungry and does not know
how long her hunger may last and how much worse it may
become.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am much obliged to you, Miss Amory,&#8221; Baird said
when he joined her, and he said it almost impetuously. To-day
he was in the state of mind when even vicarious good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
deeds are a support and a consolation. To have been a means
of doing a good turn even to this stray creature was a comfort.
</p>
<p>Miss Amory removed her hand from Susan&#8217;s arm and
allowed Baird to place it on his own. The girl went away
in obedience to a gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She will do,&#8221; said Miss Amory, &#8220;and it is a home for
her. She&#8217;s not stupid. If she fulfils the promise of her
first day I may end by interesting myself in developing her
brains. She has brains. The gray matter is there, but it
has never moved much so far. It will be interesting to set
it astir. But it was not that I thought of when I took her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You took her out of the kindness of your heart,&#8221; said
Baird.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I took her for that poor, dead child&#8217;s sake,&#8221; returned
Miss Amory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Baird began.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For Margery&#8217;s sake,&#8221; put in Miss Amory. &#8220;Margery
Latimer. When Susan was in trouble the child was a tender
little angel to her. Lord! what a pure little heart it was!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As pure as young Eve&#8217;s in the Garden of Eden&mdash;as pure
as young Eve&#8217;s,&#8221; murmured Baird.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that!&#8221; said Miss Amory, rather sharply. &#8220;How
do you know it?&#8221; And she turned and looked at him.
&#8220;You have heard her brother say a good deal of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; Baird answered. &#8220;She seems to have been
the life of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; with emotional abruptness. &#8220;I took this
girl for her sake. Her short life was not wasted if another&#8217;s
is built upon it. That&#8217;s one of my fantastic fancies, I suppose.
Stop a minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old woman paused a few moments on the garden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
walk and turned her face upward to look at the blue height
and expanse of sky. There was a shade of desperate appeal
or question on her uplifted, rugged countenance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When the world gets too much for me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
I lose my patience with the senselessness of the tragedy of
it, I get a sort of courage from looking up like this&mdash;into
the height and the still, clear blueness. It sends no answer
back to me&mdash;that my human brain can understand&mdash;but it
makes me feel that perhaps there is no earth at all. I get
out of it and away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know&mdash;I know&mdash;though I am not like you,&#8221; Baird
said, slowly.
</p>
<p>Miss Amory came back to earth with a curious look in
her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I should think that perhaps you
are one of those who know. But one has to have been desperate
before one turns to it as a resource. It&#8217;s a last one&mdash;and
the unmerciful powers only know why we should
feel it a resource at all. As I said, it does not answer back.
And we want answers&mdash;answers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then they went on walking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That poor thing has been a woman at least,&#8221; said Miss
Amory. &#8220;I have been a sort of feminine automaton. I
have been respectable and she has not. All good women
are not respectable and all respectable women are not good.
That&#8217;s a truism so absolute that it is a platitude, and yet
there still exist people to whom it would appear a novel
statement. That poor creature has loved and had her heart
broken. She has suffered the whole gamut of things. She
has been a wife without a name, a mother without a child.
She is full of crude tragedy. And I have found out already
that she is good&mdash;good.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is goodness?&#8221; asked Baird.
</p>
<p>Miss Amory gave him another of her sharp looks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are drawing me out,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not really
worth it. Goodness is quite different from respectability.
Respectability is a strict keeping of the laws men have made
to oblige other men to do or not to do the things they want
done or left undone. The large meaning of the law is punishment.
No law, no punishment; no punishment, no law.
And man made both for man. If you keep man&#8217;s law you
will be respectable, but you may not be good. Jesus Christ
was not respectable&mdash;no one will deny that. Goodness, after
all, means doing all kindness to all creatures, and, above all,
doing no wrong to any. That&#8217;s all. Are you good?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I am not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would probably find it more difficult to be so than
I should,&#8221; she responded. &#8220;And I find it hard enough&mdash;without
being handicapped by beauty and the pleasure-loving
temperament. You were started well on the road to the
devil when you were born. Your very charms and virtues
were ready to turn out vices in disguise. But when such
things happen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and she shrugged her lean shoulders.
&#8220;As we have no one else to dare to blame, we can only blame
ourselves. In a scheme so vague every man must be his
own brake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird drew a sharp breath. &#8220;If one only knew that early
enough,&#8221; he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>Miss Amory laughed harshly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;part of the vagueness of the scheme&mdash;if
it <i>is</i> a scheme&mdash;is that it takes half a lifetime to find it
out. Before that, we are always either telling ourselves that
we are not going to do any harm, or that we are under the
guidance of a merciful Providence.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That we are not going to do any harm,&#8221; Baird repeated,
&#8220;that we are not going to do any harm. And suddenly it&#8217;s
done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And can&#8217;t be undone,&#8221; Miss Amory added. &#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl, Susan Chapman, was watching them from a window
as they walked and talked. She bit her lips anxiously
as she stood behind the curtain. She was trying to imagine
what they might be saying to each other. Suppose it was
something which told against her. And why should it not
be so? What good could be said? Janway&#8217;s Mills had borne
in upon her the complete sense of her outcast state. While
professing a republican independence of New England spirit,
the place figuratively touched its forehead to the earth before
Miss Starkweather. She lived on an income inherited
from people who had owned mills instead of working them;
who employed&mdash;and discharged&mdash;hands. She would have
been regarded as an authority on any subject, social or moral.
And yet it was she who had spoken the first lenient word
to a transgressor of the unpardonable type. Susan had been
dumfounded at first, and then she had begun to be afraid
that the leniency arose from some mistake Miss Amory
would presently discover.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;s heard and he&#8217;s telling her now,&#8221; she said,
breathlessly, as she looked into the garden. &#8220;Maybe she&#8217;ll
come in and order me out.&#8221; She looked down at her clean
dress, and a sob rose in her throat at the realisation of the
mere physical comfort she had felt during the last hour or
two&mdash;the comfort of being fed and clothed and enclosed
within four walls. If she was to be cast back into outer
darkness again it would be better to know at once.
</p>
<p>When Baird had gone away and Miss Amory was sitting
by her window, Susan appeared before her again with an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
ashen complexion and a set look. She stood a moment, hesitating,
her hands clasping her elbows behind her back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to say something to me?&#8221; said Miss Amory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the girl answered. &#8220;Yes, I do&mdash;an&#8217; I don&#8217;t know
how. Are you sure, ma&#8217;am, are you sure you know quite
how bad I have been?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Miss Amory; &#8220;sit down and tell me, Susan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She said it with an impartiality so serenely free from condemnation
that Susan&#8217;s obedient sitting down was almost
entirely the result of not being able to stand up. She, so
to speak, fell into a chair and leaned forward, covering her
face with her hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you know,&#8221; she whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By experience I know next to nothing,&#8221; Miss Amory
answered, &#8220;but my imagination and my reason tell me a
great deal. You were not married and you had a child.
You lost your health and your work&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have worked,&#8221; said the girl from behind her
hands, sobbingly, but without tears. &#8220;Oh, I would have
worked till I dropped&mdash;I did work till I dropped. I kept
fainting&mdash;Oh! I would have been glad and thankful and
grateful&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Amory, &#8220;life got worse and worse&mdash;they
all treated you as if you were a dog. Those common
virtuous people are like the torturers of the Inquisition.
You were hungry and cold&mdash;cold and hungry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like,&#8221; Susan moaned. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t know. When you get sick and hollow and cramped,
and stagger about in your bare room&mdash;and call out to yourself
to ask what made you and where is it. And the wind&#8217;s
like ice&mdash;and you huddle in a heap&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And there are lights in the streets,&#8221; said Miss Amory,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
&#8220;and it seems as if there must be something there to be
given to you by somebody&mdash;somebody. And you go out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Susan got up, panting, and stared at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do know,&#8221; she cried, almost with passion. &#8220;Somehow
you&#8217;ve found out what it&#8217;s like. I wanted you to
know. I don&#8217;t want you&mdash;not to understand and then
of a sudden to send me away. I&#8217;m so <i>afraid</i> of you sending
me away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not send you away for anything you have done
in the past,&#8221; said Miss Amory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I should have done in the future,
if you hadn&#8217;t taken me in,&#8221; Susan said. &#8220;Perhaps I should
have thrown myself under a train. But, oh!&#8221; with starting
dampness in her skin, which she wiped off with a sick gesture,
&#8220;I did <i>hate</i> to let myself think of it. It wasn&#8217;t the
being killed&mdash;that&#8217;s nothing&mdash;but feeling yourself crushed
and torn and twisted&mdash;I used to stand and shake all over
thinking of it. And I couldn&#8217;t have gone on. I hated
myself&mdash;I hated everything&mdash;most of all I hated the Thing
that made me. What right had it? I hadn&#8217;t done nothing
to it before I was born. Seemed like it had made me just
for the fun of pushing me under them wheels and seeing
them tear and grind me. Oh! how I hated it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; said Miss Amory, her steady eyes looking
more like a hawk&#8217;s than ever.
</p>
<p>Susan stared more than before. &#8220;I suppose I ought to
have hated Jack Williams,&#8221; she went on, her throat evidently
filling, &#8220;but I never did. I loved him. Seemed
like I was just his wife, that it did. I believe it always
will. That&#8217;s the way girls get into trouble. Some man
that&#8217;s got an affectionate way makes &#8217;em believe they&#8217;re
as good as married. An&#8217; then they find out it&#8217;s all a lie.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps some day you may see Jack Williams again,&#8221;
said Miss Amory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t look at me,&#8221; answered Susan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you wouldn&#8217;t look at him,&#8221; Miss Amory remarked,
with speculative slowness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I would,&#8221; said Susan, &#8220;yes I would. I couldn&#8217;t
trust him same as I did before&mdash;&#8217;cause he&#8217;s proved he ain&#8217;t
to be trusted. But if he wanted me to marry him I couldn&#8217;t
hold out, Miss Starkweather.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Miss Amory said, still speculative. &#8220;No&mdash;perhaps
you couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl wiped her eyes and added, slowly, almost as if
she was thinking aloud:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not one of the strong ones&mdash;I&#8217;m not one of the
strong ones&mdash;no more than little Margery was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She said the last words with a kind of unconscious consciousness.
While she uttered them her mind had evidently
turned back to other times&mdash;not her own, but little Margery&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>Miss Amory drew a deep breath. She took up her knitting.
She asked a question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew her very well&mdash;Margery?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Susan drew her chair closer and looked in the old face
with uncertain eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Starkweather,&#8221; she said, &#8220;do you think that a
girl&#8217;s being&mdash;like me&mdash;would make her evil-minded?
Would it make her suspicion things, and be afraid of them&mdash;when
there wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217;? I should think that it would,&#8221;
quite wistfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might,&#8221; answered Miss Amory, her knitting-needles
flying; &#8220;but for God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t call yourself evil-minded.
You&#8217;d be evil-minded if you were <i>glad</i> to suspect&mdash;not if
you were sorry and afraid.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Glad!&#8221; with a groan. &#8220;Oh, Lord, I guess not. But
I might be all wrong all the same, mightn&#8217;t I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you might.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved her&mdash;oh, Lord, I did love her! I&#8217;d reason to,&#8221;
the girl went on, and her manner had the effect of frightened
haste. &#8220;I&#8217;ve suffered awful sometimes&mdash;thinkin&#8217; in the
night and prayin&#8217; there wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217;. She was such a delicate,
innocent little thing. It would have killed her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you afraid of?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Susan answered, hysterically. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t. I only knew she couldn&#8217;t bear nothin&#8217; like&mdash;like
lyin&#8217; awake nights gaspin&#8217; an&#8217; fightin&#8217; with awful fear. She
couldn&#8217;t&mdash;she couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are girls&mdash;women, who have to bear it,&#8221; said
Miss Amory. &#8220;Good God, who <i>have</i> to!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes,&#8221; cried Susan. She drew her hand across
her brow as if suddenly it felt damp, and for a moment her
eyes looked wild with a memory of some awful thing. &#8220;I
told her so,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Miss Amory Starkweather turned in her chair with something
like a start.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You told her so,&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>Susan stared out of the window and her voice fell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t go to,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;It was like this. That
last time she came to see me&mdash;to tell me how ill she was
and how Lucien was going to take her away&mdash;I&#8217;d been lookin&#8217;
at the little clothes I&#8217;d got ready for&mdash;it.&#8221; The tears
began to roll fast down her cheeks. &#8220;Oh, Miss Starkweather!
they was lyin&#8217; on the bed&mdash;an&#8217; she saw &#8217;em an&#8217;
turned as white as a sheet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; the sound broke from Miss Amory like a short,
involuntary groan.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She said she didn&#8217;t know how people could <i>bear</i> it,&#8221;
Susan hurried on, &#8220;an&#8217; I said&mdash;just like you did&mdash;that they
<i>had</i> to bear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She suddenly hid her face in her arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were thinking of yourself,&#8221; said Miss Amory. She
felt and looked a little sick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Susan, &#8220;I was thinkin&#8217; of how it is when
a girl&#8217;s goin&#8217; to have a child an&#8217; can&#8217;t get away from it&mdash;can&#8217;t&mdash;can&#8217;t.
She&#8217;s got to go through with it&mdash;an&#8217; no one
can&#8217;t save her. But I suppose it made her think of her death
that was comin&#8217;&mdash;her death that I b&#8217;lieve she knowed she
was struck for. When I&#8217;d said it she looked like some little
hunted animal dogs was after&mdash;that had run till its breath
was gone an&#8217; its eyes was startin&#8217; from its head. Her little
chest went up an&#8217; down with pantin&#8217;. I didn&#8217;t wonder when
I heard after that she&#8217;d dropped in the street in a dead faint.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that the day I picked her up as she lay on the
pavement?&#8221; Miss Amory asked.
</p>
<p>Susan nodded, her face still hidden.
</p>
<p>Old Miss Starkweather put out her hand and laid it on
the girl&#8217;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has had time to forget,&#8221; she said, rather as if she
was out of breath&mdash;&#8220;forget and grow quiet. She is dust
by now&mdash;peaceful dust. Let us&mdash;my good girl&mdash;let us remember
that happy story of how she died.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Susan, &#8220;in Italy&mdash;lying before the open
window&mdash;with the sunset all rosy in the sky.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But her head rested on her folded arms upon her knee,
and she sobbed a low, deep sob.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p>Just before the breaking out of the Civil War, Delisleville
had been provided with a sensation in a piece of singularly
unexpected good fortune which befell one of its most
prominent citizens. It was indeed good fortune, wearing
somewhat the proportions of a fairy tale, and that such things
could happen in Delisleville and to a citizen who possessed
its entire approval was considered vaguely to the credit of
the town.
</p>
<p>One of the facts which had always been counted as an
added dignity to the De Willoughbys had been their well-known
possession of property in land. &#8220;Land&#8221; was always
felt to be dignified, and somehow it seemed additionally so
when it gained a luxuriously superfluous character by merely
lying in huge, uncultivated tracts, and representing nothing
but wide areas and taxes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Them big D&#8217;Willerbys of D&#8217;lisleville owns thousands of
acres as never brings &#8217;em a cent,&#8221; Mr. Stamps had said to
his friends at the Cross-roads at the time Big Tom had first
appeared among them. It was Mr. Stamps who had astutely
suggested that the stranger was possibly &#8220;kin&#8221; to the Delisleville
family, and in his discreet pursuit of knowledge he
had made divers discoveries.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twarn&#8217;t Jedge D&#8217;Willerby bought the land,&#8221; he went
on to explain, &#8220;&#8216;n&#8217; it seems like he would hev bin a fool
to hev done it, bein&#8217; as &#8217;tain&#8217;t worked an&#8217; brings in nothin&#8217;.
But ye never know how things may turn out. &#8217;Twas the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
Jedge&#8217;s gran&#8217;father, old Isham D&#8217;Willerby bought it fer a
kinder joke. Some said he was blind drunk when he done
it, but he warn&#8217;t so drunk but what he got a cl&#8217;ar title, an&#8217;
he got it mighty cheap too. Folks ses as he use ter laugh
an&#8217; say he war goin&#8217; to find gold on it, but he never dug
fer none&mdash;nor fer crops nuther, an&#8217; thar it lies to-day in the
mountains, an&#8217; no one goin&#8217; nigh it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In truth, Judge De Willoughby merely paid his taxes upon
it from a sense of patriarchal pride.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My ancestor bought it,&#8221; he would say. &#8220;I will hand
it to my sons. In England it would be an estate for an
earldom, here it means merely tax-paying. Still, I shall not
sell it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nobody, in fact, would have been inclined to buy it in
those days. But there came a time when its value increased
hour by hour in the public mind, until it was almost beyond
computation.
</p>
<p>A chance visitor from the outside world made an interesting
discovery. On this wild tract of hill and forest was
a vein of coal so valuable that, to the practical mind of the
discoverer, the Judge&#8217;s unconsciousness of its existence was
amazing. He himself was a practical, driving, business
schemer from New York. He knew the value of what he
saw, and the availability of the material in consequence of
a certain position in which the mines lay. Before he left
Delisleville he had explained this with such a presenting
of facts that the Judge had awakened to an enthusiasm
as Southern as his previous indifference had been. He had
no knowledge of business methods; he had practised his
profession in a magnificent <i>dilettante</i> sort of way which had
worn an imposing air and impressed his clients, and, as he
was by inheritance a comparatively rich man, he had not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
been driven by necessity to alter his methods. The sudden
prospect of becoming a multimillionaire excited him. He
made Napoleonic plans, and was dignified and eloquent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I form a company?&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I am
willing to make the first ventures myself, the inevitable returns
of profit will do the rest, and there will be no complications.
The De Willoughby Mine will be the De Willoughby
Mine alone. I prefer that it should be so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The idea of being sole ruler in the scheme made him feel
rather like a king, and he privately enjoyed the sensation.
He turned into money all the property he could avail himself
of; his library table was loaded with books on mining;
he invested in tons of machinery, which were continually
arriving from the North, or stopping on the way when it
should have been arriving. He sent for engineers from
various parts of the country and amazed them with the unprofessional
boldness of his methods. He really indulged
in a few months of dignified riot, of what he imagined to
be a splendidly executive nature. The plans were completed,
the machinery placed, the engineers and cohorts
of workmen engaged in tremendous efforts, the Judge was
beginning to reflect on the management of his future millions,
when&mdash;the first gun was fired on Fort Sumter.
</p>
<p>That was the beginning, and apparently the end. Suddenly
the storm of war broke forth, and its tempest, surging
through the land, swept all before it. The country was
inundated with catastrophes, capitalists foundered, schemes
were swamped, the armies surged to and fro. The De Willoughby
land was marched and fought over; scores of hasty,
shallow graves were dug in it and filled; buildings and machinery
were destroyed as if a tornado had passed by. The
Judge was a ruined man; his realisable property he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
allowed to pass from his hands, his coal remained in the
bowels of the earth, the huge income he was to have drawn
from it had melted into nothingness.
</p>
<p>Nothing could have altered the aspect of this tragedy;
but there was a singular fact which added to its intensity
and bitterness. In such a hot-bed of secession as was Delisleville,
the fact in question was indeed not easily explainable,
except upon the grounds either of a Quixotic patriotism
or upon those of a general disposition to contradictoriness.
A Southern man, the head of a Southern family, the
Judge opposed the rebellion and openly sided with the Government.
That he had been a man given to argument and
contradiction, and always priding himself upon refusing to
be led by the majority was not to be denied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is fancying himself a Spartan hero, and looking forward
to laurels and history,&#8221; one of his neighbours remarked.
&#8220;It is like De Willoughby after all. He would have been
a Secessionist if he had lived in Boston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Union General George Washington fought for and
handed down to us <i>I</i> will protect,&#8221; the Judge said loftily
himself.
</p>
<p>But there was no modifying the outburst of wonder and
condemnation which overwhelmed him. To side with the
Union&mdash;in an aristocratic Southern town&mdash;was to lose social
caste and friends, to be held a renegade and an open, degraded
traitor to home and country. At that period, to the
Southerner the only country was the South&mdash;in the North
reigned outer darkness. Had the Judge been a poor white,
there would have been talk of tar and feathers. As a man
who had been a leader among the aristocratic classes, he
was ostracized. In the midst of his financial disasters he
was treated as an outlaw. He had been left a widower a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
few years before, during the war his son De Courcy died
of fever, Romaine fell in battle, and his sole surviving daughter
lost her life through diphtheria contracted in a soldiers&#8217;
hospital. The family had sunk into actual poverty; the
shock of sorrows and disappointment broke the old man&#8217;s
spirit. On the day that peace was finally declared he died
in his room in the old house which had once been so full
of young life and laughter and spirit.
</p>
<p>The only creature with him at the time was his grandson,
young Rupert De Willoughby, who was De Courcy&#8217;s son.
The sun was rising, and its first beams shone in at the open
window rosily. The old Judge lay rubbing his hands slowly
together, perhaps because they were cold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only you left, Rupert,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and there were so
many of us. If Tom&mdash;if Tom had not been such a failure&mdash;don&#8217;t
know whether he&#8217;s alive&mdash;or dead. If Tom&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>His hands slowly ceased moving and his voice trailed off
into silence. Ten minutes later all was over, and Rupert
stood in the world entirely alone.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>For the next two years the life the last De Willoughby
lived in the old house, though distinctly unique, was not
favourable to the development of youth. Having been prepared
for the practice of the law, after the time-honoured
De Willoughby custom, and having also for some months
occupied a corner in the small, unbusiness-like, tree-shaded,
brick building known as the Judge&#8217;s &#8220;office,&#8221; Rupert sat
now at his grandfather&#8217;s desk and earned a scant living by
endeavouring to hold together the old man&#8217;s long-diminished
practice. The profession at the time offered nothing
in such places as Delisleville, even to older and more experienced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
men. No one had any money to go to law with,
few had any property worth going to law about.
</p>
<p>Both armies having swept through it, Delisleville wore
in those days an aspect differing greatly from its old air of
hospitable well-being and inconsequent good spirits and
good cheer. Its broad verandahed houses had seen hard
usage, its pavements were worn and broken, and in many
streets tufted with weeds; its fences were dilapidated, its
rich families had lost their possessions, and those who had not
been driven away by their necessities were gazing aghast at
a future to which it seemed impossible to adjust their ease-loving,
slave-attended, luxurious habits of the past. Houses
built of wood, after the Southern fashion, do not well withstand
neglect and ill-fortune. Porticos and pillars and trellis-work
which had been picturesque and imposing when they
had been well cared for, and gleamed white among creepers
and trees, lost their charm drearily when paint peeled off,
trees were cut down, and vines were dragged away and died.
Over the whole of the once gay little place there had fallen
an air of discouragement, desolation, and decay. Financial
disaster had crippled the boldest even in centres much more
energetic than small, unbusiness-like Southern towns; the
country lay, as it were, prostrate to recover strength, and
all was at a standstill.
</p>
<p>Finding himself penniless, Rupert De Willoughby lived
in a corner of the house he had been brought up in. Such
furniture as had survived the havoc of war and the entire
dilapidation of old age, he had gathered together in three
or four rooms, which he occupied with the one servant good
fortune brought to his door at a time when the forlornness
of his changed position was continually accentuated by the
untidy irregularity of his life and surroundings. He was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
only able to afford to engage the shiftless services of a slatternly
negro girl, rendered insubordinate by her newly acquired
freedom, and he had begun to feel that he should
never again find himself encompassed by the decorous system
of a well-managed household.
</p>
<p>It was at this juncture that Uncle Matthew arrived and
presented his curious petition, which was that he should
be accepted as general servant, with wages or without them.
</p>
<p>He had not belonged to Judge De Willoughby, but to
a distant relative, and, as he was an obstinate and conservative
old person, he actually felt that to be &#8220;a free nigger&#8221;
was rather to drop in the social scale.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whar&#8217;s a man stand, sah, if he ain&#8217;t got no fambly?&#8221;
he said to Rupert when he came to offer his services to him.
&#8220;He stan&#8217; nowhar, that&#8217;s war he stan&#8217;; I&#8217;ve got to own up
to it, Marse Rupert, I&#8217;se a &#8217;ristycrat bawn an&#8217; bred, an&#8217; I
&#8217;low to stay one, long&#8217;s my head&#8217;s hot. Ef my old mars&#8217;s
fambly hadn&#8217;t er gone fo&#8217;th en&#8217; bin scattered to de fo&#8217; win&#8217;s
of de university, I&#8217;d a helt on, but when de las&#8217; of &#8217;um
went to dat Europe, dey couldn&#8217;t &#8217;ford to take me, an&#8217; I
had ter stay. An&#8217; when I heerd as all yo&#8217; kin was gone an&#8217;
you was gwine to live erlone like dis yere, I come to ax yer
to take me to wait on yer&mdash;as a favier, Marse Rupert&mdash;as
a <i>favier</i>. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t pay I wants, sah; it&#8217;s a fambly name an&#8217;
a fambly circle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not much of a circle, Uncle Matt,&#8221; said Rupert,
looking round at the bareness of the big room he sat in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t much fer you, suh,&#8221; answered Uncle Matthew,
&#8220;but it&#8217;s a pow&#8217;fle deal fer me in dese yere days. Ef yer
don&#8217;t take me, fust thing I knows I&#8217;ll be drivin&#8217; or waitin&#8217;
on some Mr. Nobody from New York or Boston, an&#8217; seems
like I shouldn&#8217;t know how to stand it. &#8217;Scuse me a-recommendin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
myself, sah&mdash;I <i>look</i> ole, but I ain&#8217;t as ole as I look;
I&#8217;se l&#8217;arnt to cook, sah, from three womens what I was
married to, an&#8217; I knows my place an&#8217; how to keep house
like it orter be kep&#8217;. Will you try me a mont&#8217;, Marse De
Willoughby&mdash;will you try me a week?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert tried him and never regretted the venture. In
fact, Uncle Matt&#8217;s accomplishments were varied for practical
reasons. He had been in his time first house servant, then
coachman; he had married at twenty a woman of forty,
who had been a sort of female mulatto Vatel. When she
had died, having overheated herself and caught cold on the
occasion of a series of great dinners given at a triumphant
political crisis, he had taken for his second wife the woman
whose ambition it had been to rival her in her culinary arts.
His third marriage had been even more distinguished. His
wife had been owned by some extravagantly rich Creoles in
New Orleans, and had even lived with them during a year
spent in France, thereby gaining unheard-of culinary accomplishments.
Matthew had always declared that he loved her
the best of the three. Those matrimonial ventures had been
a liberal education to him. He had learned to cook almost
as well as his first, and from his second and third he had
inherited methods and recipes which were invaluable. He
seemed to have learned to do everything. He dismissed the
slatternly negro girl and took upon himself the duties of
both man and woman servant. The house gradually wore
a new aspect&mdash;dust disappeared, windows were bright, the
scant furniture was arranged to the best possible advantage,
the scant meals were marvels of perfect cookery and neat
serving. Having prepared a repast, Uncle Matt donned an
ancient but respectable coat and stood behind his young
master&#8217;s chair with dignity. The dramatic nature of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
race was strongly appealed to by the situation in which he
found himself. A negro of his kind is perfectly capable of
building a romance out of much smaller materials. The
amiable vanity which gave such exalted value to all the belongings
of their masters in their days of slavery, and which
so delighted in all picturesqueness of surrounding, is the
best of foundations for romances. From generation to generation
certain circumstances and qualities had conferred
a sort of distinction upon their humbleness; to be owned
by an aristocrat, to live in a great house, to wait upon young
masters who were handsome and accomplished and young
mistresses who were beautiful and surrounded by worshippers,
to be indispensable to &#8220;de Jedge&#8221; or &#8220;de Cun&#8217;l,&#8221; or
to travel as attendant because some brilliant young son or
lovely young daughter could find no one who would wait
on them as &#8220;Uncle Matt&#8221; or &#8220;Aunt Prissy&#8221; could&mdash;these
things made life to be desired and filled it with excitement
and importance.
</p>
<p>To the halcyon days in which such delights were possible
Uncle Matt belonged. He was too old to look forward; he
wanted his past again; and to find himself the sole faithful
retainer in a once brilliant household, with the chance of
making himself indispensable to the one remaining scion of
an old name, assisted him to feel that he was a relic of departed
grandeur.
</p>
<p>His contrivances were numberless. In a corner of what
he called the &#8220;back gyarden&#8221; he constructed an enclosure
for chickens. He bought two or three young fowls, and by
marvels of management founded a family with them. The
family once founded, he made exchanges with friendly coloured
matrons of the vicinity, with such results in breeding
that &#8220;Uncle Matt&#8217;s&#8221; chickens became celebrated fowls. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
displayed the same gifts in the management of the garden.
In a few months after his arrival, Rupert began to find himself
sitting down before the kind of meal he had not expected
to contemplate again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Matt,&#8221; he said, &#8220;where do I get fried chicken
and vegetables like these&mdash;and honey and fresh butter and
cream? I don&#8217;t pay for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you do, sah. Yo&#8217; property pays for &#8217;em. Dat &#8217;ar
gyarden, sah, is black with richness&mdash;jest black. It&#8217;s a
forchen for a pusson what kin contrive an&#8217; make fren&#8217;s, an&#8217;
trade, an&#8217; kin flourish a spade. Dar&#8217;s fruit-trees an&#8217; grape-vines
dar&mdash;an&#8217; room enuf to plant anything&mdash;an&#8217; richness
enuf to make peas an&#8217; taters an&#8217; beets an&#8217; cabbages jest jump
out o&#8217; de yarth. I&#8217;ve took de liberty of makin&#8217; a truck
patch, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve got me a chicken coop, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve had mighty
good luck with my aigs an&#8217; my truck&mdash;an&#8217; I&#8217;ve got things
to trade with the women folks for what I <i>ain&#8217;t</i> got. De
ladies likes tradin&#8217;, an&#8217; dey&#8217;s mighty neighbourly about
yeah, &#8217;memberin&#8217; yo&#8217; fambly, sah.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert leaned back in his chair and broke into a hearty,
boyish laugh, which it was very good both to see and hear.
He very seldom laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I was a genius like you, Matt,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What
luck I&#8217;m in to have you. Raising chickens and vegetables,
and negotiating with your lady friends for me! I feel like
a caliph with a grand vizier. I never tasted such chicken
or such waffles in my life!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m settin&#8217; some tukkey-eggs now&mdash;under de yaller
hen,&#8221; said Matt, with a slyly exultant grin. &#8220;She&#8217;s a good
mother, the yaller hen; an&#8217; de way dem fruit-trees is gwine
ter be loaded is a sight. Aunt Mary Field, she&#8217;s tradin&#8217; with
me a&#8217;ready agin fruit puttin&#8217;-up time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>Rupert got up from his chair. He caught old Matt&#8217;s
dusky, yellow-palmed paw in his hand and shook it hard.
His gloomy young face had changed its aspect, his eyes suddenly
looked like his mother&#8217;s&mdash;and Delia Vanuxem had
been said to have the loveliest soft eyes in all the South.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Matt,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do without you. It isn&#8217;t
only <i>that</i>,&#8221; with a gesture towards the table, &#8220;you&mdash;it&#8217;s
almost as if you had come to save me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ole nigger man like me, Marse Rupert,&#8221; said Uncle
Matt, &#8220;savin&#8217; of a fine young gentleman like what you is!
How&#8217;s I gwine ter do it?&#8221; But his wrinkled face looked
tremulous with emotion. &#8220;Times is gwine ter change for
you, they is, an&#8217; Matt&#8217;s gwine ter stay by yer till dat come
to pass. Marse Rupert,&#8221; looking at him curiously, &#8220;I &#8217;clar
to Gawd you look like yo&#8217; young mammy did. Yo&#8217; ain&#8217;t always,
but jes&#8217; dish yer minnit yo&#8217; does&mdash;an&#8217; yer did jes&#8217;
now when yer laf&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look like her?&#8221; said Rupert. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it.
I want to be like her. Say, Uncle Matt, whenever I look
or speak or act like her, you tell me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When in the course of neighbourly conversation Matt
mentioned this to his friend Aunt Mary Fields, she put a
new colour upon it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He worshipped his maw, an&#8217; she jest &#8217;dored down on
him,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but &#8217;tain&#8217;t only he want look like her,
he <i>doan</i>&#8217; want look like his paw. Ev&#8217;one know what Cun&#8217;l
de Courcy was&mdash;an&#8217; dat chile jest &#8217;spise him. He was allus
a mons&#8217;ous proud chile, and when de Cun&#8217;l broke loose an&#8217;
went on one o&#8217; his t&#8217;ars, it mos&#8217; &#8217;stroyed dat boy wid de
disgracefulness. Dar&#8217;s chil&#8217;en as doan&#8217; keer or notice&mdash;but
dat boy, it &#8217;most &#8217;stroyed him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The big, empty-sounding house was kept orderly and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
spotless, the back garden exhibited such vegetables as no
one else owned, the fruit-trees and grape-vines throve, in
time the flower-beds began to bloom brilliantly, the rose-bushes
and shrubs were trimmed, the paths swept, and people
began to apply to Uncle Matt for slips and seeds. He
himself became quite young again, so inspired was he by
his importance and popularity. When he went into the
town upon errands, people stopped to talk to him; the young
business or professional men called him into their offices
to have a chat with him. He was such a respectable relic
of the times which had been &#8220;better days&#8221; to all of them,
that there were those who were almost confidential with
him. Uncle Matt would always understand their sentiments
and doctrines, and he was always to be relied on for any
small service. Such a cocktail or julep no one else could
prepare, and there were numerous subtle accomplishments
in the matter of mixing liquid refreshments which would
have earned a reputation for any man.
</p>
<p>There was no more familiar figure than his in the market
or business streets of the hot, sunshine-flooded little town,
which the passing armies had left so battered and deserted.
</p>
<p>Uncle Matt knew all the stories in Delisleville. He knew
how one house was falling to pieces for lack of repairs; he
heard of the horses that had been sold or had died of old
age and left their owners without a beast to draw their rickety
buggies or carriages; he was deeply interested in the
failing fortunes of what had once been the most important
&#8220;store&#8221; in the town, and whose owner had been an aristocratic
magnate, having no more undignified connection with
the place than that of provider of capital.
</p>
<p>As he walked up Main Street on his way to market, with
his basket on his arm, he saw who had been able to &#8220;lay
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
in new stock&#8221; and who had not. He saw the new sign-boards
hung outside small houses which had been turned
into offices. He knew what young scion of a respectable
family had begun &#8220;doctoring&#8221; or &#8220;set up as a lawyer.&#8221;
Sometimes he even dropped in and made brief visits of
respectful congratulation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he said privately to his young master, &#8220;de air
ob de atmosphere, it&#8217;s jest full of dem young lawyers an&#8217;
doctors. Dar don&#8217;t seem to be nothin&#8217; else for a gen&#8217;leman&#8217;s
sons to do but to kyore people or go to law for &#8217;em. Of cose
dey oughtn&#8217;t ter hab ter work, gen&#8217;lemen oughtn&#8217;ter. Dey
didn&#8217;t usen to heb ter, but now dey is gotter. Lawdy,
Marse Rupert, you&#8217;ll hatter &#8217;scuse me, but de young lawyers,
an&#8217; de young doctors, dey is scattered about dish yer
D&#8217;lisleville!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were certain new sign-boards which excited him
to great interest. There was one he never passed without
pausing to examine and reflect upon it.
</p>
<p>When he came within range of it on his way up the street,
his pace would slacken, and when he reached it he would
stop at the edge of the pavement and stand with his basket
on his arm, gazing at the lettering with an absorbed air of
interest and curiosity. It read, &#8220;Milton January, Claim
Agent.&#8221; He could not read, but he had heard comments
made upon the profession of the owner of this sign-board
which had filled him with speculative thought. He shared
the jealousy of strangers who came from &#8220;the North&#8221; to
Delisleville and set up offices, which much more intelligent
persons than himself burned with. He resented them as
intruders, and felt that their well-dressed air and alert, business-like
manner was an insult to departed fortunes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What they come fer?&#8221; he used to grumble. &#8220;Takin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
away trade an&#8217; business when they ain&#8217;t none left for de
proper people nohow. How&#8217;s we gwine ter live if all New
York City an&#8217; Bos&#8217;n an&#8217; Philadelphy pours in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not pouring in very fast, Uncle Matt,&#8221; Rupert
answered him once. &#8220;Perhaps it would be better for us if
they did. They bring <i>some</i> money, at any rate. There are
only one or two of them, and one is a claim agent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s jest what I wants ter know,&#8221; said Matt. &#8220;What&#8217;s
dey layin&#8217; claim to? What right dey got ter claim anythin&#8217;?
Gawd knows dar ain&#8217;t much ter claim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert laughed and gave him a friendly, boyish slap on
the back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not claiming things <i>from</i> people, but <i>for</i> them.
They look up claims against the Government and try to get
indemnity for them. They prove claims to back pay, and
for damages and losses, and try to make the Government
refund.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Uncle Matt rubbed his head a minute, then he looked up
eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cun&#8217;l De Willoughby, now,&#8221; he said; &#8220;doan&#8217; you s&#8217;pose
dar&#8217;s some back pay owin&#8217; to him for de damage dat yaller
fever done him wot he done cotch from de army?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert laughed a little bitterly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What dey gwine to refun&#8217;, den?&#8221; said Matt. &#8220;Dat&#8217;s
what I&#8217;d like ter fin&#8217; out. Dis hyer idee of refun&#8217;in&#8217; please
me mightily. I&#8217;d be pow&#8217;fle glad to come bang up agin&#8217;
some refun&#8217;in&#8217; myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From that time his interest in Milton January, Claim
Agent, increased week by week. He used to loiter about
talking groups if he caught the sound of his name, in the
hope of gathering information. He was quite shrewd enough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
to realise his own entire ignorance of many subjects, and
he had the pride which prevented his being willing to commit
himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but a ole nigger,&#8221; he used to say. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t had no eddication like some er dese yere smarties what
kin read an&#8217; cipher an&#8217; do de double shuffle in de copy-book.
Matt ain&#8217;t never rub his back &#8217;gin no college wall. Bes&#8217;
thing he knows is dat he doan&#8217; know nothin&#8217;. Dat&#8217;s a
pow&#8217;fle useful piece o&#8217; l&#8217;arnin&#8217; to help a man, black or white,
from makin&#8217; a fool er hesself bigger dan what de good Lawd
&#8217;tended him fer ter be. Matt he gradyuated in dat &#8217;ar knowledge
an&#8217; got he stiffikit. When de good Lawd turn a man
out a fool, he got ter <i>be</i> a fool, but he needn&#8217; ter be a bigger
fool den what he <i>gotter</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So he listened in the market, where he went every morning
to bargain for his bit of beefsteak, or fish, or butter, and
where the men and women who kept the stalls knew him
as well as they knew each other. They all liked him and
welcomed him as he approached in his clean old clothes, his
market basket on his arm, his hat set rather knowingly upon
his grizzled wool. He was, in fact, rather a flirtatious old
party, and was counted a great wit, and was full of a shrewd
humour as well as of grandiloquent compliment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I has a jocalder way er talkin&#8217;, I ain&#8217;t gwine ter deny,&#8221;
he would say when complimented upon his popularity with
the fair sex, &#8220;an&#8217; dey ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; de ladies likes mo&#8217; dan
a man what&#8217;s jocalder. Dey loves jokin&#8217; an&#8217; dey loves to
laff. It&#8217;s de way er de sect. A man what cayn&#8217;t be jocalder
with &#8217;em, he hain&#8217;t no show.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What dis hyer claim agentin&#8217; I&#8217;s hearin&#8217; so much talk
about?&#8221; he enquired of a group one morning. &#8220;What <i>I</i>
wants is ter get inter de innards of de t&#8217;ing, an&#8217; den I&#8217;se
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
gwine to claim sump&#8217;n fer myse&#8217;f. If dar&#8217;s claimin&#8217; gwine
on, I&#8217;se a gen&#8217;leman what&#8217;s gwine to be on de camp-meetin&#8217;
groun&#8217;, an&#8217; fo&#8217;most &#8217;mong de shouters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did ye lose by the war, Uncle Matt?&#8221; said a
countryman, who was leaning against his market waggon
of &#8220;produce&#8221; and chewing tobacco. &#8220;If ye kin hunt
up suthin&#8217; ye lost, ye kin put in a claim fer the vally of
it, an&#8217; mebbe get Government to give ye indemnity. Mebbe
ye kin an&#8217; mebbe ye cayn&#8217;t. They ain&#8217;t keen to do it, but
mebbe ye could work it through a smart agent like January.
They say he&#8217;s as smart as they make &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a broiling July morning; only the people who were
obliged to leave their houses for some special reason were
to be seen in the streets; the market waggons which had
come in from the country laden with vegetables and chickens
and butter were drawn up under the shadow of the market
house, that their forlorn horses or mules might escape
the glaring hot sun. The liveliest business hour had passed,
and about the waggons a group of market men and women
and two or three loiterers were idling in the shade, waiting
for chance-belated customers. There was a general drawing
near when Uncle Matt began his conversation. They always
wanted to hear what he had to say, and always responded
with loud, sympathetic guffaws to his &#8220;jocalder&#8221; remarks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sech a case, Uncle Matt is,&#8221; the women would say,
&#8220;I never seen sich a case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the countryman spoke, Uncle Matt put on an expression
of dignified thoughtfulness. It was an expression
his audience were entirely familiar with and invariably
greeted with delight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Endurin&#8217; of de war,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I los&#8217; severial things.
Fust thing I memberize of losin&#8217; was a pa&#8217;r of boots. Dar
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
was a riggiment passin&#8217; at de time, an&#8217; de membiers of dat
riggiment had been footin&#8217; it long enough to have wo&#8217; out
a good deal er shoe-leather. They was thusty an&#8217; hungry,
an&#8217; come to de halt near my cabin to require if dar warn&#8217;t
no vittles lyin&#8217; roun&#8217; loose for de good er de country. When
dey was gone, my new boots was gone, what I&#8217;d jest brung
home from de cobbler.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His audience broke into a shout of enjoyment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat &#8217;ar incerdent stirred up my paketriotit feelin&#8217;s consider&#8217;ble
at de moment. I couldn&#8217;t seem to see it in de light
what p&#8217;raps I oughter seen it in. I rared roun&#8217; a good deal,
an&#8217; fer a moment er two, I didn&#8217;t seem tar mind which side
beat de oder. Jest dat &#8217;casion. I doan&#8217; say de sentiment
continnered on, but jest dat &#8217;casion seemed ter me like dar
was a Yank somewhars es I wouldn&#8217;t hev ben agin seein&#8217;
takin&#8217; a whuppin&#8217; from some&#8217;un, Secesh or no Secesh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What else did ye lose, Unc&#8217; Matt?&#8221; someone said when
the laugh died down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I lose a wife&mdash;kinder cook dat dar ain&#8217;t no &#8217;demnity
kin make up fer when de Lawd&#8217;s removed &#8217;em. An&#8217;
&#8217;pears to me right dar, dat if I wusn&#8217;t a chu&#8217;ch member, I
shed be led on ter say dat, considerin&#8217; what a skaseness er
good cooks dar is, seems like de good Lawd&#8217;s almost wasteful
an&#8217; stravagant, de way he lets &#8217;em die off. Three uv &#8217;em he
&#8217;moved from me to a better worl&#8217;. Not as I&#8217;m a man what&#8217;d
wanter be sackerligious; but &#8217;pears to me dar was mo&#8217; wuk
fur &#8217;em to do in dis hyer dark worl&#8217; er sin dan in de realms
er glory. I may be wrong, but dat&#8217;s how it seem to a pore
nigger like me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Government won&#8217;t pay for yer wife, Matt,&#8221; said the
owner of the market waggon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat dey won&#8217;t, en dat dey cayn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Matt. &#8220;Dat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
las&#8217; woman&#8217;s gumbo soup warn&#8217;t a thing to be &#8217;demnified
fer, dat it warn&#8217;t. But what I&#8217;m a aimin&#8217; at is to fin&#8217; out
what dey <i>will</i> pay fer, en how much. Dar was one mawnin&#8217;
I sot at my do&#8217; reflectin&#8217; on de Gawsp&#8217;l, an&#8217; de Yanks come
jest a tarin&#8217; down de road, licketty switch, licketty switch,
yellin&#8217; like de debil let loose, en firin&#8217; of dere pistols, an&#8217; I
gotter &#8217;fess I los&#8217; a heap a courage dat time&mdash;an&#8217; I los&#8217; a
heap o&#8217; breath runnin&#8217; &#8217;way from &#8217;em en outer sight. Now
I know de Gov&#8217;ment not gwine ter pay me fer losin&#8217; dem
things, but what <i>is</i> dey gwine pay for losin&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Property, they say&mdash;crops &#8216;n&#8217; houses, &#8216;n&#8217; barns, &#8216;n&#8217; truck
wuth money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Uncle Matt removed his hat, and looked into the crown
of it as if for instruction before he wiped his forehead and
put it on again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye-yi! Dey is, is dey?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Property&mdash;en
houses, en barns, en truck wuth money? Dey&#8217;ll hev a plenty
to pay, ef dey begins dat game, won&#8217;t dey? Dey&#8217;ll hev ter
dig down inter de Gov&#8217;ment breeches pocket pretty deep,
dat dey will. Doan&#8217; see how de Pres&#8217;dent gwine ter do it
out&#8217;n what dey &#8217;lows him, less&#8217;n dey &#8217;lows him mighty big
pocket money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t the President, Matt,&#8221; said one of the crowd.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the Nation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s de Nation!&#8221; said Matt. &#8220;De Nation. Well,
Mr. Nation gwine fin&#8217; he got plenty ter do&mdash;early <i>en</i> late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was not the last time he led the talk in the direction
of Government claims, and in the course of his marketings
and droppings into various stores and young lawyers&#8217; offices,
he gathered a good deal of information. Claims upon the
Government had not been so far exploited in those days as
they were a little later, and knowledge of such business and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
its processes was not as easily obtainable by unbusiness-like
persons.
</p>
<p>One morning, as he stood at the street corner nearest the
Claim Agent&#8217;s office, a little man came out of the place, and
by chance stopped to cool himself for a few moments under
the shade of the very maple tree Uncle Matt had chosen.
</p>
<p>He was a very small man, wearing very large pantaloons,
and he had a little countenance whose expression
was a curious combination of rustic vacancy and incongruous
slyness. He was evidently from the country, and
Uncle Matt&#8217;s respectable, in fact, rather aristocratic air, apparently
attracted his attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Scuse me, sah,&#8221; said Matt, &#8220;&#8217;scuse me addressin&#8217; of you,
but dem ar Claim Agents&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hev ye got a claim?&#8221; said the little man in words that
were slow, but with an air that was sharp. &#8220;I mean, has
anyone ye work fur got one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sah,&#8221; answered Matt, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t sartain, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;d better make sartain,&#8221; said the little man. &#8220;Bein&#8217;
es the thing&#8217;s started the way it hes, anyone es might hev a
claim an&#8217; lets it lie, is a derned fool. I come from over the
mountain. My name&#8217;s Stamps, and <i>I&#8217;ve</i> got one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Uncle Matt regarded him with interest&mdash;not exactly with
respect, but with interest.
</p>
<p>Stamps took off his battered broad-brimmed hat, wiped
his moist forehead and expectorated, leaning against the
tree.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s people in this town as is derned fools,&#8221; he remarked,
sententiously. &#8220;Thar&#8217;s people in most every town
in the Union as is derned fools. Most everybody&#8217;s got a
claim to suthin&#8217;, if they&#8217;d only got the common horse sense
ter look it up. Why, look at that yoke o&#8217; oxen o&#8217; mine&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
finest yoke o&#8217; steers in Hamlin County. Would hev took
fust ticket at any Agricultural Fair in the United States. I
ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to sacceryfist them steers to no Stars an&#8217; Stripes
as ever floated. The Guv&#8217;ment&#8217;s <i>got</i> to pay me the wuth of
&#8217;em down to the last cent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gave Matt a sharp look with a hint of inquiry in it, as
if he was asking either his hearer or himself a question, and
was not entirely certain of the answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now thar&#8217;s D&#8217;Willerby,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Big Tom&mdash;Tom
D&#8217;Willerby lost enough, the Lord knows. Fust one
army, &#8216;n&#8217; then another layin&#8217; holt on his stock as it come
over the road from one place an&#8217; another, a-eatin&#8217; of it up
&#8216;n&#8217; a-wearin&#8217; his goods made up into shirts &#8216;n&#8217; the like-&#8216;n&#8217;
him left a&#8217;most cleaned out o&#8217; everythin&#8217;. Why, Tom
D&#8217;Willerby&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Scuse me, sah,&#8221; interrupted Matt, &#8220;but did you say
De Willoughby?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said D&#8217;Willerby,&#8221; answered Mr. Stamps. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what he&#8217;s called at the Cross-roads.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There he stopped and stared at Matt a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My young master&#8217;s name&#8217;s De Willoughby, sah,&#8221; Matt
said; &#8220;&#8216;n&#8217; de names soun&#8217;s mighty simulious when dey&#8217;s
spoke quick. My young Marse, Rupert De Willoughby, he
de gran&#8217;son er Jedge De Willoughby, an&#8217; de son an&#8217; heir er
Cun&#8217;l De Courcy De Willoughby what died er yaller fever
at Nashville.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p>Rupert De Willoughby was lying upon the grass in the
garden under the shade of a tree. The &#8220;office&#8221; had been
stifling hot, and there had been even less to suggest any hope
of possible professional business than the blankness of most
days held. There never was any business, but at rare intervals
someone dropped in and asked him a question or so,
his answers to which, by the exercise of imagination, might
be regarded as coming under the head of &#8220;advice.&#8221; His
clients had no money, however&mdash;nobody had any money; and
his affairs were assuming a rather desperate aspect.
</p>
<p>He had come home through the hot streets with his straw
hat pushed back, the moist rings of his black hair lying
on a forehead lined with a rather dark frown. He went into
the garden and threw himself on the grass in the shade.
He could be physically at ease there, at least. The old garden
had always been a pleasure to him, and on a hot summer
day it was full of sweet scents and sounds he was fond of.
At this time there were tangles of honeysuckle and bushes
heavy with mock-orange; an arbour near him was covered
by a multiflora rose, weighted with masses of its small, delicate
blossoms; within a few feet of it a bed of mignonette
grew, and the sun-warmed breathing of all these fragrant
things was a luxurious accompaniment to the booming of
the bees, blundering and buzzing in and out of their flowers,
and the summer languid notes of the stray birds which lit
on the branches and called to each other among the thick
leaves.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>At twenty-three a man may be very young. Rupert was
both young and old. His silent resentment of the shadow
which he felt had always rested upon him, had become a
morbid thing. It had led him to seclude himself from the
gay little Delisleville world and cut himself off from young
friendships. After his mother&mdash;who had understood his
temperament and his resentment&mdash;had died, nobody cared
very much for him. The youth of Delisleville was picturesque,
pleasure-loving, and inconsequent. It had little parties
at which it danced; it had little clubs which were vaguely
musical or literary; and it had an ingenuous belief in the
talents and graces displayed at these gatherings. The feminine
members of these societies were sometimes wonderfully
lovely. They were very young, and had soft eyes and soft
Southern voices, and were the owners of the tiniest arched
feet and the slenderest little, supple waists in the world.
Until they were married&mdash;which usually happened very
early&mdash;they were always being made love to and knew that
this was what God had made them for&mdash;that they should
dance a great deal, that they should have many flowers and
bonbons laid at their small feet, that beautiful youths with
sentimental tenor voices should serenade them with guitars
on moonlight nights, which last charming thing led them
to congratulate themselves on having been born in the South,
as such romantic incidents were not a feature of life in New
York and Boston. The masculine members were usually
lithe and slim, and often of graceful height; they frequently
possessed their share of good looks, danced and rode well,
and could sing love songs. As it was the portion of their
fair companions to be made love to, it was theirs to make
love. They often wrote verses, and they also were given
to arched insteps and eyes with very perceptible fringes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
For some singular reason, it seems that Southern blood tends
to express itself in fine eyes and lashes.
</p>
<p>But with this simply emotional and happy youth young
De Willoughby had not amalgamated. Once he had gone
to a dance, and his father the Colonel had appeared upon
the scene as a spectator in a state of exaggeratedly graceful
intoxication. He was in the condition when he was extremely
gallant and paid flowery compliments to each pair
of bright eyes he chanced to find himself near.
</p>
<p>When he first caught sight of him, Rupert was waltzing
with a lovely little creature who was a Vanuxem and was
not unlike the Delia Tom De Willoughby had fallen hopelessly
in love with. When he saw his father a flash of scarlet
shot over the boy&#8217;s face, and, passing, left him looking very
black and white. His brow drew down into its frown, and
he began to dance with less spirit. When the waltz was at
an end, he led his partner to her seat and stood a moment
silently before her, glancing under his black lashes at the
Colonel, who had begun to quote Thomas Moore and was
declaiming &#8220;The Young May Moon&#8221; to a pretty creature
with a rather alarmed look in her uplifted eyes. It was the
first dance at which she had appeared since she had left
school.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Rupert turned to his partner. He made her
a bow; he was a graceful young fellow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss Vanuxem. Thank you for the dance.
Good-night. I am going home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; exclaimed little Miss Vanuxem. &#8220;But it
is so early, Mr. De Willoughby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have stayed just ten minutes too long now,&#8221; said
Rupert. &#8220;Thank you again, Miss Vanuxem. Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He walked across the room to Colonel De Willoughby.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am going home,&#8221; he said, in a low, fierce voice; &#8220;you
had better come with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No sush thing,&#8221; answered the Colonel, gaily. &#8220;On&#8217;y
just come. Don&#8217;t go to roosh with shickens. Just quoting
Tom Moore to Miss Baxter.
</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>The little beauty, who had turned with relieved delight
to take the arm of a new partner, looked at her poetic admirer
apologetically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gaines has come for me, Colonel De Willoughby,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;I am engaged to him for this dance.&#8221; And
she slipped away clinging almost tenderly to the arm of her
enraptured escort, who felt himself suddenly transformed
into something like a hero.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel De Willoughby is so flattering,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and
he has such a queer way of paying compliments. I&#8217;m
almost frightened of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will see that he does not speak to you again,&#8221; said her
partner, with an air of magnificent courage. &#8220;He should
not have been allowed to come in. You, of course, could
not understand, but&mdash;the men who are here will protect
the ladies who are their guests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert gave his father a long look and turned on his heel.
He went home, and the next time the Terpsichorean Society
invited him to a dance he declined to go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice fellow I am to go to such places,&#8221; he said to himself.
&#8220;Liable to bring a drunken lunatic down upon them
at any minute. No, the devil take it all, I&#8217;m going to stay
at home!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>He stayed at home, and gradually dropped out of the
young, glowing, innocently frivolous and happy world altogether,
and it carried on its festivities perfectly well without
him. The selfishness of lovely youth is a guileless, joyous
thing, and pathetic inasmuch as maturity realises the undue
retribution which befalls it as it learns of life.
</p>
<p>When poverty and loneliness fell upon him, the boy had
no youthful ameliorations, even though he was so touchingly
young. Occasionally some old friend of his grandfather&#8217;s
encountered him somewhere and gave him rather
florid good advice; some kindly matron, perhaps, asked him
to come and see her; but there was no one in the place who
could do anything practical. Delisleville had never been
a practical place, and now its day seemed utterly over. Its
gentlemanly pretence at business had received blows too
heavy to recover from until times had lapsed; in some of
the streets tiny tufts of grass began to show themselves between
the stones.
</p>
<p>As he had walked back in the heat, Rupert had observed
these tiny tufts of green with a new sense of their meaning.
He was thinking of them as he lay upon the grass, the warm
scent of the mock-orange blossoms and roses, mingled with
honeysuckle in the air, the booming of the bees among the
multiflora blooms was in his ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;There is nothing
to be done here. There never was much, and now there
is nothing. I can&#8217;t loaf about and starve. I won&#8217;t beg from
people, and if I would, I haven&#8217;t a relation left who isn&#8217;t
a beggar himself&mdash;and there are few enough of them left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a well-worn
greenback. He straightened out its creases cautiously and
looked at it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got two dollars,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and no prospect of getting
any more. Even Matt can&#8217;t make two dollars last long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The latch of the side gate clicked and the gate opened.
Presently Uncle Matt appeared round the rose-bushes. He
had his market basket on his arm and wore a thoughtful
countenance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Matt!&#8221; Rupert called out to him. &#8220;I wish you
would come here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his darkling moods, he was in a subtle
way singularly like Delia Vanuxem. He needed love and
tenderness, and he was boy enough yet to be unhappy and
desolate through lack of them, though without quite knowing
why. He knew Uncle Matt loved him, and the affectionate
care the old man surrounded him with was like a warm
robe wrapped about a creature suffering from chill. He had
not analyzed his feeling himself; he only knew that he liked
to hear his footsteps as he pottered about the house, and
when he was at his dreariest, he was glad to see him come
in, and to talk a little to him.
</p>
<p>Uncle Matt came towards him briskly. He set his basket
down and took off his hat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marse Rupert,&#8221; he said, &#8220;dis hyer&#8217;s a pow&#8217;fle scorcher
of a mawnin&#8217;. Dem young lawyers as shets up dey office
an&#8217; comes home to lie in de grass in de shade, dey is follerin&#8217;
up dey perfession in de profitablest way&mdash;what&#8217;ll be likely
to bring &#8217;em de mos&#8217; clients, &#8217;cause, sho&#8217;s yo&#8217; bawn, dere&#8217;s
sunstroke an&#8217; &#8217;cussion or de brain just lopin&#8217; roun&#8217; dis
town&mdash;en a little hot brick office ain&#8217;t no place for a
young man what got any dispect fur his next birfday.
Dat&#8217;s so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t much respect for mine,&#8221; said Rupert; &#8220;I&#8217;ve
had twenty-two too many&mdash;just twenty-two.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Scusin&#8217; me sayin&#8217; it, sah, but dat ain&#8217;t no way ter talk.
A man boun&#8217; to have some dispect for his birfday&mdash;he <i>boun&#8217;</i>
to! Birfdays gotter be took keer on. Whar&#8217;s a man when
he runs out of &#8217;em?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better run out of them before he runs out of everything
else,&#8221; said Rupert. &#8220;Matt, I&#8217;ve just made two dollars
this month.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at the old man with a restless appeal in his
big, deer-like eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry, Matt,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m terribly sorry, but
you know&mdash;we can&#8217;t go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Uncle Matthew looked down at the grass with a reflective
air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marse Rupert, did you never heah nothin&#8217; &#8217;bout your
Uncle Marse Thomas De Willoughby?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert was silent a moment before he answered, but it
was not because he required time to search his memory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, and then was silent again. He had heard
of poor Tom of the big heart from his mother, and there
had been that in her soft speech of him which had made
the great, tender creature very real. Even in his childhood
his mother had been his passion, as he had been hers.
Neither of them had had others to share their affection, and
they were by nature creatures born to love. His first memory
had been of looking up into the soft darkness of the
tender eyes which were always brooding over him. He had
been little more than a baby when he had somehow known
that they were very sorrowful, and had realised that he loved
them more because of their sorrow. He had been little older
when he found out the reason of their sadness, and from
that time he had fallen into the habit of watching them,
and knowing their every look. He always remembered the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
look they wore when she spoke of Tom De Willoughby,
and it had been a very touching one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said to Uncle Matt, &#8220;I have heard of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dar was a time, a long way back, Marse Rupert&mdash;&#8217;fore
you was borned&mdash;when I seemed to year a good deal &#8217;bout
Marse Thomas. Dat was when he went away in dat curi&#8217;s
fashion. Nobody knowed <i>whar</i> he went, an&#8217; nobody knowed
quite <i>why</i>. It wus jes&#8217; afore ye&#8217; maw an&#8217; paw wus married.
Some said him an&#8217; de Jedge qua&#8217;lled &#8217;cause Marse Thomas
he said he warn&#8217;t gwine ter be no medical student, an&#8217;
<i>some</i> said he was in love with some young lady dat wouldn&#8217;t
&#8217;cept of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they?&#8221; said Rupert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat dey did,&#8221; Matt said; &#8220;an&#8217; a lot moah. But ev&#8217;rybody
think it mighty strange him a-gwine, an&#8217; no one never
huntin&#8217; him up afterwards. Seemed most like dey didn&#8217;t
keer nothin&#8217; &#8217;bout him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t, damn them!&#8221; said Rupert, with sudden
passion. &#8220;And he was worth the whole lot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat what make I say what I gwine ter,&#8221; said Matt, with
some eagerness. &#8220;What I heerd about Marse Thomas make
me think he must be er mighty fine gen&#8217;leman, an&#8217; one
what&#8217;d be a good fren&#8217; to anyone. An&#8217; dishyer ve&#8217;y mawnin&#8217;
I heerd sump&#8217;n mo&#8217; about him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert raised himself upon his elbow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About Uncle Tom!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You have heard
something about Uncle Tom to-day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I foun&#8217; out whar he went, Marse Rupert,&#8221; said Matt,
much roused. &#8220;I foun&#8217; out whar he <i>is</i> dishyer ve&#8217;y instep.
He&#8217;s in Hamlin County, keepin&#8217; sto&#8217; an&#8217; post-office at Talbot&#8217;s
Cross-roads; an&#8217;, frum what I heah, Marse Tom De
Willoughby de mos&#8217; pop&#8217;larist gen&#8217;leman an&#8217; mos&#8217; looked
up ter in de county.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;who did you hear it from?&#8221; demanded Rupert.
</p>
<p>Uncle Matt put his foot upon a rustic seat near and leaned
forward, resting his elbow on his knee and making impressive
gestures with his yellow-palmed old hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was dishyer claimin&#8217; dat brung it about,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;dishyer claimin&#8217; an&#8217; &#8217;demnification what&#8217;s been a-settin&#8217;
pow&#8217;fle heavy on my min&#8217; fur long &#8217;nuff. Soon&#8217;s I yeerd
tell on it, Marse Rupert, it set me ter steddyin&#8217;. I been
a-watchin&#8217; out an&#8217; axin&#8217; questions fur weeks, an&#8217; when I
fin&#8217; out&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what has that to do with Uncle Tom?&#8221; cried
Rupert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A heap, Marse Rupert. Him an&#8217; you de onliest heirs
to de De Willoughby estate; an&#8217; ef a little hoosier what&#8217;s
los&#8217; a yoke er oxen kin come down on de Guv&#8217;ment for

dat wus gwine ter make yo&#8217; grandpa a millionaire&mdash;whar is
dey? What de Yankees done with dem gol&#8217; mines?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&#8217;t gold mines, Uncle Matt,&#8221; said Rupert;
&#8220;they were coal mines; and the Yankees didn&#8217;t carry them
away. They only smashed up the machinery and ruined
things generally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But he laid back upon the grass again with his hands
clasped behind his head and his brow drawn down thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Coal mines <i>er</i> gol&#8217; mines,&#8221; said Uncle Matt. &#8220;Guv&#8217;ment
gotter &#8217;demnify ef things er managed right; en dat what

I ses, an&#8217; from dat I foun&#8217; out de rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to see him,&#8221; said Rupert; &#8220;I always
thought I should like to know where he was&mdash;if he was
alive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why doan&#8217; you go an&#8217; see him, den?&#8221; said Matt. &#8220;Jest

</p>
<p>Rupert lay still and looked straight before him, apparently
at a bluebird balanced on a twig, but it was not the
bird he was thinking of.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;se young, Marse Rupert, an&#8217; it &#8217;ud be purty dang&#8217;rous

</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p>The years had passed for the child Sheba so sweetly, and
had been so full of simple joys and pleasures, that they
seemed a panorama of lovely changing seasons, each a thing
of delight. There was the spring, when she trotted by Tom&#8217;s
side into the garden and he showed her the little, pale-green
points of the crocuses, hyacinths, and tulips pushing their
way up through the moist brown earth, and when he carried
her in his big arms into the woods on the hillsides, and they
saw the dogwood covered with big white flowers and the
wild plum-trees snowed over with delicate blooms, and found
the blue violets thick among the wet grass and leaves, and
the frail white wind-flowers quivering on their stems. As
they went about in this new fairyland, which came every
year, and which still seemed always a surprise, it was their
habit to talk to each other a great deal. The confidences
they had exchanged when the child had not been able to
speak, and which Tom had nevertheless understood, were
enchanting things when she became older and they strayed
about together or sat by the fire. Her child thoughts and
fancies might have been those of some little faun or dryad
She grew up among green things, with leaves waving above
and around her, the sun shining upon her, and the mountains
seeming to stand on guard, looking down at her from
day to day, from year to year. From behind one mountain
the sun rose every morning, and she always saw it; and
behind another it sank at night. After the spring came
the summer, when the days were golden and drowsy and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
hot, and there were roses and other flowers everywhere; wild
roses in the woods and by the waysides, heavy-headed beauties
in their own garden, and all the beds and vines a fine
riot of colour. After these there were blackberries thick
on their long brambles, and wild grapes in the woods, and
presently a delicious snap of cold in the clear air night and
morning, and the trees were dropping golden, amber, and
scarlet leaves, while under the pale yellow ones which rustled
beneath the chestnut-trees, there were brown, glossy nuts,
which fell one by one with a delightful suddenness of sound
at irregular intervals. There were big chestnut-trees in the
woods near their house, and Tom and Sheba used to go
before breakfast to look for the nuts which had fallen in
the night. Hamlin County always rose at sunrise, or before
it, and to go out in the heavenly fresh morning air and walk
through the rustling, thickly fallen yellow leaves under the
trees, making little darts of joy at the brown, glossy things
bursting through their big burrs, was a delicious, exciting
thing. Mornin&#8217;s hot breakfast held keen delights when they
returned to it.
</p>
<p>When the big wood-fires were lighted and there was snow
and rain outside, and yams and chestnuts to roast in the
ashes, and stories to be told and talked over in the glow of
the red birch-log and snapping, flaming hickory sticks, the
child used to feel as if she and Uncle Tom were even nearer
together and more comfortable than at any other time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom,&#8221; she said to him, as she was standing in the
circle of his arm on one such night, when she was about
ten years old. &#8220;Uncle Tom, we do love each other in the
winter, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we do, Sheba,&#8221; answered Tom. &#8220;And we&#8217;re pretty
partial to each other even in the summer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We love each other at all the times,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And
every morning that I get up I love you more than I did
when I went to bed&mdash;<i>every</i> morning, Uncle Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom kissed her. He remembered what he had said one
morning in the cabin in Blair&#8217;s Hollow ten years before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, if there&#8217;s no one to come between us, she may
be fond of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was fond of him. He was her very little life itself.
No one had ever come between&mdash;nothing ever could.
</p>
<p>She had by that time shot up into a tall, slender slip
of a girl-child. She was passing, even with a kind of distinction,
through the stage of being all long, slim legs
and big eyes. The slim legs were delicately modelled and
the big eyes were like pools of gold-brown water, fringed
with rushes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never seen a young &#8217;un at thet thar young colty age
es was es han&#8217;some es thet child o&#8217; Big Tom&#8217;s,&#8221; Mis&#8217; Doty
often remarked.
</p>
<p>By the frequenters of the Cross-roads Post-office she was
considered, as was her protector, a county institution. When
she had reached three years old, she had been measured
against the wall, and each year her increase of inches was
recorded amid lively demonstrations of interest. The smallness
of her feet had also been registered, and the thickness
and growth of her curling hair ranked as a subject of discussion
only second in interest to the development of crops.
</p>
<p>But this affection notwithstanding, a curious respect for
her existed. She had played among them in the store in
her little dusty pinafore; one and all of them had given her
rustic offerings, bringing her special gifts of yellow popcorn
ears, or abnormal yams unexpectedly developed in their own
gardens, or bags of hickory nuts; but somehow they did not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
think or speak of her as they did of each other&#8217;s children.
</p>
<p>Tom had built a comfortable white house, over whose
verandah honeysuckles and roses soon clambered and hung.
In time the ground enclosed about it had a curious likeness
to the bowery unrestraint of the garden he had played in
during his childhood. It was a pleasure to him to lay it out
on the old plan and to plant japonicas, flowering almonds,
and syringa bushes, as they had grown in the days when he
had played under them as a child, or lounged on the grass
near them as a boy. He and Sheba planted everything themselves&mdash;or,
rather, Sheba walked about with him or stood
by his side and talked while he worked. In time she knew
almost as well as he did the far-away garden he took as his
model. She learned to know the place by heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you a little boy then, Uncle Tom?&#8221; she would
say, &#8220;when there was a mock-orange and a crape myrtle next
to the big yellow rose-bush?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were even times when he found her memory was
better than his own, and she could correct him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! no, Uncle Tom,&#8221; she would say; &#8220;the pansies were
not in the little heart-shaped bed; they were all round the
one with the pink harp-flower in the middle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she was six years old he sent for some books and
began seriously to work with a view to refreshing his memory
on subjects almost forgotten.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m preparing myself for a nursery governess, Sheba,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;What we want is a nursery governess, and I don&#8217;t
know where to find one. I shouldn&#8217;t know how to manage
her if I did find her, so I&#8217;ve got to post up for the position
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The child was so happy with him in all circumstances,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
that it was easy to teach her anything. She had learned
to read and write before she discovered that the process she
went through to acquire these accomplishments was not an
agreeable pastime specially invented by Tom for her amusement.
At eleven years old she had become so interested
in her work that she was quite an excited little student. By
the time she was twelve Tom began to shake his head at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you go on like this,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I sha&#8216;n&#8217;t be able to
keep up with you, and what I&#8217;ve got to do is to keep ahead.
If I can&#8217;t, I shall have to send you to the Academy at
Ralston; and how should we stand that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She came and sat upon his big knee&mdash;a slim little thing,
as light as a bird.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t stand it, Uncle Tom,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We <i>have</i>
to be together. We always have been, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221; And
she rubbed her ruffled head against his huge breast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we always have been,&#8221; answered Tom; &#8220;and it
would go pretty hard with us to make a change, Sheba.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was not sent to Ralston. The war broke out and altered
the aspect of things even at the Cross-roads. The bank
in which Tom&#8217;s modest savings were deposited was swept
away by misfortune; the primitive resources of Hamlin
County were depleted, as the resources of all the land were.
But for the existence of the white, vine-embowered house
and the garden full of scents and bloom, Tom&#8217;s position
at the close of the rebellion was far less fortunate than it
had been at the time the mystery of Blair&#8217;s Hollow had occurred.
In those old, happy-go-lucky days the three rooms
behind the store and the three meals Mornin cooked for him
had been quite sufficient for free and easy peace. He had
been able to ensure himself these primitive comforts with
so little expenditure that money had scarcely seemed an object.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
He had taken eggs in exchange for sugar, bacon in
exchange for tea, and butter in exchange for everything.
Now he had no means of resource but the store, and the
people were poorer than they had been. Farms had gone
to temporary ruin through unavoidable neglect during the
absence of their masters. More than one honest fellow had
marched away and never returned, and their widows were
left to struggle with the land and their children. The Cross-roads
store, which had thriven so wonderfully for a year
or two before the breaking out of the war, began to wear
a less cheerful aspect. As far as he himself was concerned,
Tom knew that life was a simple enough thing, but by his
side there was growing up a young goddess. She was not
aware that she was a young goddess. There was no one in
the vicinity of the Cross-roads who could have informed
her that she presented somewhat of that aspect, and that
she was youth and happiness and Nature&#8217;s self at once.
</p>
<p>Tom continually indulged in deep reflection on his charge
after she was twelve years old. She shot up into the tall
suppleness of a lovely young birch, and she was a sweetly
glowing thing. A baby had been a different matter; the
baby had not been so difficult to manage; but when he found
himself day by day confronting the sweetness of child-womanhood
in the eyes that were gold-brown pools, and the softening
grace of the fair young body, he began to be conscious
of something like alarm. He was not at all sure what he
ought to do at this crisis, and whether life confining its
experiences entirely to Talbot&#8217;s Cross-roads was all that was
required.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s right, by thunder,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s right; and that&#8217;s what a man
who&#8217;s taken the place of a young mother ought to know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>There came a Sunday when one of the occasional &#8220;preachings&#8221;
was to be held at the log-cabin church a few miles
distant, and they were going together, as they always did.
</p>
<p>It was a heavenly, warm spring morning, and Sheba, having
made herself ready, wandered into the garden to wait
among the flowers. The rapturous first scents of the year
were there, drawn by the sun and blown by vagrant puffs
of wind from hyacinths and jonquils, white narcissus and
blue violets. Sheba walked among the beds, every few minutes
kneeling down upon the grass to bury her face in pink
and yellow and white clusters, inhaling the breath of flowers
and the pungent freshness of the sweet brown earth at the
same time. She had lived among leaves and growing things
until she felt herself in some unexplainable way a part of
the world they belonged to. The world beyond the mountains
she knew nothing of; but this world, which was the
brown earth springing forth into green blades and leaves and
little streaked buds, warming into bloom and sun-drenched
fragrance, setting the birds singing and nest-building, giving
fruits and grain, and yellow and scarlet leaves, and
folding itself later in snow and winter sleep&mdash;this world
she knew as well as she knew herself. The birds were singing
and nest-building this morning, and, as she hung over
a bed of purple and white hyacinths, kneeling on the grass
and getting as close to them as she could, their perfume
mounted to her brain and she began to kiss them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you,&#8221; she said, dwelling on their sweet coolness
with her lips; &#8220;I love and love you!&#8221; And suddenly she
made a little swoop and kissed the brown earth itself. &#8220;And,
oh! I love you, too!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I love you, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked like young spring&#8217;s self when she stood up
as Tom came towards her. Her smile was so radiant a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
thing that he felt his heart quake with no other reason
than this sight of her happy youth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you thinking of, Sheba?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am thinking,&#8221; she said, as she glanced all about her,
the smile growing more entrancing, &#8220;I am thinking how
happy I am, and how happy the world is, and how I love
you, and,&#8221; with a pretty laugh, &#8220;the flowers, and the sun,
and the earth&mdash;and everything in the world!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tom, looking at her tenderly. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
spring, Sheba.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She caught his arm and clung to it, laughing again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;and when it isn&#8217;t the spring, it
is the summer; and when it isn&#8217;t the summer, it is the autumn;
and when it isn&#8217;t the autumn, it is the winter; and
we sit by the fire and know the spring is making its way
back every day. Everything is beautiful&mdash;everything is
happy, Uncle Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; exclaimed Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; Sheba asked. &#8220;Why do you
look so&mdash;so puzzled, Uncle Tom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom, holding her out at arm&#8217;s length before
him, &#8220;the truth is, I&#8217;ve suddenly realised something. I&#8217;d
like to know what I&#8217;m to do with <i>this</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This?&#8221; laughed Sheba. &#8220;Am I &#8216;this&#8217;? You look
at me as if I was &#8216;this&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are,&#8221; Tom answered, ruefully. &#8220;Here you suddenly
change to a young woman on a man&#8217;s hands. Now,
what am I to do with a grown-up young woman? I&#8217;m used
to babies, and teething, and swallowing kangaroos out of
Noah&#8217;s arks&mdash;and I know something of measles and letting
tucks out of frocks; but when it comes to a beautiful young
woman, there you have me!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>He shook his head as he ended, and, though his face wore
the affectionate, humorous smile which had never failed her,
there was a new element in its kindness which, it must be
confessed, bordered on bewilderment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A beautiful, grown-up young woman,&#8221; he said, glancing
reflectively over her soft, swaying slimness, her white frock
with its purple ribbon and golden jonquils, and up to her
tender cheek.
</p>
<p>Sheba blushed with sweet delight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I beautiful, Uncle Tom?&#8221; she inquired, with a
lovely anxiousness in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you are,&#8221; admitted Tom; &#8220;and it isn&#8217;t a drawback
to you, Sheba, but it&#8217;s likely to make trouble for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In novels, and poetry, and sometimes in real life,
beautiful young women are fallen in love with, and then
trouble is liable to begin,&#8221; explained Tom with amiable
gravity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no one to fall in love with me at the Cross-roads,&#8221;
said Sheba, sweetly. &#8220;I wish there was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord,&#8221; exclaimed Tom, devoutly. &#8220;Come along
to church, Sheba, and let&#8217;s go in for fasting and prayer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took her to the &#8220;preaching&#8221; in the log cabin and noticed
the effect of her entry on the congregation as they
went in. There were a number of more or less awkward and
raw-boned young male creatures whose lives were spent chiefly
in cornfields and potato patches. They were uncomely
hewers of wood and drawers of water, but they turned their
heads to look at her, and their eyes followed her as she
went to her seat. When she had sat down, those who could
catch glimpses of her involuntarily craned their necks and
sat in discomfort until the sermon was over. Tom recognised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
this fact, and in secret reflected upon it in all its
bearings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he found himself saying, mentally; &#8220;I&#8217;d like to
know how I&#8217;m going to do my duty by <i>this</i>. I don&#8217;t believe
there&#8217;s a derned thing about it in &#8216;Advice to Young
Mothers.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The day wore on to its lovely end, and lost itself in one
of the sunsets which seem to flood the sky with a tide of
ripples of melted gold, here and there tipped with flame.
When this was over, a clear, fair moon hung lighted in the
heavens, and, flooding with silver what had been flooded
with gold, changed the flame-tips to pearl.
</p>
<p>Sheba strayed in the garden among the flowers. Tom,
sitting under the vines of the porch, watched her white figure
straying in and out among the shrubbery. At last he saw
her standing on the grass in the full radiance of the moonlight,
her hands hanging clasped behind her and her face
turned upward to the sky. As she had wandered about, she
had done a fanciful thing. She had made a wreath of white
narcissus and laid it on her hair, and she had twisted together
a sort of long garland of the same blossoms and cast it loosely
round her waist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She never did that before,&#8221; Tom said, as he watched her.
&#8220;Good Lord! what a picture she is, standing there with her
face lifted. I wonder what she&#8217;s thinking of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom,&#8221; she said, when she sauntered back to him,
&#8220;does the moonlight make you feel sad without being unhappy
at all? That is what it does to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the spring, Sheba,&#8221; he said, as he had said it in the
morning; &#8220;it&#8217;s the spring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She saw that he was looking at her flower garlands, and
she broke into a shy little laugh.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You see what you have done to me, Uncle Tom,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;now you have told me I am a beautiful young woman,
I shall always be doing things to&mdash;to make myself look prettier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She came on to the verandah to him, and he held out
his hand to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the spring, too, Sheba,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>She yielded as happily and naturally to the enfolding of his
big arm in these days as she had done when she was a baby.
No one but themselves knew what they were to each other.
</p>
<p>They had always talked things over together&mdash;their affection,
their pleasures, their simple anxieties and responsibilities.
They had discussed her playthings in the first years
of their friendship and her lessons when she had been a
little girl. To-night the subject which began to occupy
them had some seriousness of aspect. The changes time
and the tide of war had made were bringing Tom face to
face with a difficulty his hopeful, easy-going nature had
never contemplated with any realising sense&mdash;the want of
money, even the moderate amount the requirements of their
simple lives made necessary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the taxes that a man can&#8217;t stand up against,&#8221; Tom
said. &#8220;You may cut off all you like, and wear your old
clothes, but there&#8217;s a liveliness about taxes that takes the
sand out of you. Talk about the green bay-tree flourishing
and increasing, all a tax wants is to be let alone a few years.
It&#8217;ll come to its full growth without any sunning or watering.
Mine have had to be left alone for a while, and&mdash;well, here
we are&mdash;another year, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will the house be taken?&#8221; Sheba asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can&#8217;t pay up, it&#8217;ll all go&mdash;house and store and all,&#8221;
Tom answered. &#8220;Then <i>we</i> shall have to go too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>He turned and looked ruefully at the face beneath the
wreath of white narcissus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish it hadn&#8217;t come on us just now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no particular season that trouble adds a charm to; but it
seems to me that it&#8217;s not entitled to the spring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she went upstairs she did not go to bed. The moonlight
lured her out into the night again. Outside her window
there was a little balcony. It was only of painted wood,
as the rest of the house was, but a multiflora rose had climbed
over it and hung it with a wonderful drapery, and, as she
stood upon it, she unconsciously made herself part of a
picture almost strange in its dramatic quality.
</p>
<p>She looked out over the sleeping land to the mountains
standing guard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where should we go?&#8221; she said. &#8220;The world is on the
other side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was not in the mood to observe sound, or she would
have heard the clear stroke of a horse&#8217;s hoofs on the road.
She did not even hear the opening of the garden gate. She
was lost in the silver beauty of the night, and a vague dreaming
which had fallen upon her. On the other side of the
purple of the mountains was the world. It had always
been there and she had always been here. Presently she
found herself sighing aloud, though she could not have
told why.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she said as softly as young Juliet. &#8220;Ah, me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As she could not have told why she sighed, so there was
no explanation of the fact that, having done so, she looked
downward to the garden path, as if something had drawn
her eyes there. It is possible that some attraction had so
drawn them, for she found herself looking into a young, upturned
face&mdash;the dark, rather beautiful face of a youth who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
stood and looked upward as if he had stopped involuntarily
at sight of her.
</p>
<p>She drew back with a little start and then bent her Narcissus-crowned
head forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;who is it?&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>He started himself at the sound of her voice. She had indeed
looked scarcely a real creature a few moments ago. He
took off his hat and answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Rupert De Willoughby,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I beg pardon
for disturbing you. It startled me to see you standing there.
I came to see Mr. Thomas De Willoughby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a singular situation. Perhaps the moonlight had
something to do with it; perhaps the spring. They stood
and looked at each other quite simply, as if they did not
know that they were strangers. A young dryad and faun
meeting on a hilltop or in a forest&#8217;s depths by moonlight
might have looked at each other with just such clear, unstartled
eyes, and with just such pleasure in each other&#8217;s
beauty. For, of a truth, each one was thinking the same
thing, innocently and with a sudden gladness.
</p>
<p>As he had come up the garden-path, Rupert had seen
a vision and had stopped unconsciously that instant. And
Sheba, looking down, had seen a vision too&mdash;a beautiful face
as young as her own, and with eyes that glowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you looked like standing there,&#8221;
said Rupert, as simply as the young faun might have spoken.
&#8220;It was as if you were a spirit. The flowers in your hair
looked like great white stars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they?&#8221; she said, and stood and softly gazed at
him.
</p>
<p>How the boy looked up at her young loveliness! He had
never so looked at any woman before. And then a thought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
detached itself from the mists of memory and he seemed
to remember.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Sheba?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am Sheba,&#8221; she answered, rather slowly. &#8220;And
I remember you, too. You are the boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew nearer to the balcony, laying his hand upon the
multiflora rose creeper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; he said, almost tremulous with eagerness.
&#8220;You bring it all back. You were a little child, and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You rode away,&#8221; she said, &#8220;over the hill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come down to me?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, and that moment disappeared.
</p>
<p>He stood in the moonlight, his head bared, his straw hat
in his hand. He felt as if he was in a dream. His face had
lost its gloom and yearning, and his eyes looked like his
mother&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>When he heard a light foot nearing him, he went forward,
and they met with strange young smiles and took each other&#8217;s
hands. Nearer than the balcony, she was even a sweeter
thing, and the scent of her white flowers floated about her.
</p>
<p>As they stood so, smiling, Tom came and joined them.
Sheba had called him as she passed his door.
</p>
<p>Rupert turned round and spoke, vaguely conscious, as
he did so, that his words sounded somewhat like words uttered
in a dream and were not such as he had planned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&mdash;Delia Vanuxem was my
mother.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p>The moment ceased to be so fanciful and curiously exalted
when his hand was grasped and a big, kind palm laid
on his shoulder, though Tom&#8217;s face was full of emotion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I should have known it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Welcome
to you. Yes,&#8221; looking at him with an affection touched
with something like reverence. &#8220;Yes, indeed&mdash;Delia
Vanuxem!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to you,&#8221; the young fellow said, with fine simplicity,
&#8220;because I am the only De Willoughby left except
yourself. I am young and I&#8217;m lonely&mdash;and my mother
always said you had the kindest heart she ever knew. I
want you to advise me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in to the porch,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;and let us sit down
and talk it over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He put his arm about Sheba and kept his hand on Rupert&#8217;s
shoulder, and walked so, with one on either side, to
the house. Between their youthful slimness he moved like
a protecting giant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221; he asked when they sat
down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From Delisleville,&#8221; Rupert answered. &#8220;I did not think
of coming here so late to-night, but it seems I must have
missed my road. I was going to ask for lodgings at a place
called Willet&#8217;s Farm. I suppose I took the wrong turning;
and when I saw this house before me, I knew it must be
yours from what I had heard of it. It seemed as if Fate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
had brought me here. And when I came up the path I
saw Sheba. She was standing on the little verandah in the
moonlight with the roses all around her; and she looked
so white that I stopped to look up at her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom,&#8221; said Sheba, &#8220;we&mdash;we knew each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His middle-aged heart surprised him by giving one quick,
soft beat. He smiled to himself after he had felt it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The first moment or so I only stood and looked,&#8221; Rupert
said; &#8220;I was startled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so was I,&#8221; said Sheba.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But when she leaned forward and looked down on me,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;I remembered something&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; said Sheba. &#8220;I leaned forward like that and
looked down at you from the porch at the tavern&mdash;all those
years ago, when I was a little child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I looked up at you&mdash;and afterwards I asked about
you,&#8221; said Rupert. &#8220;It all came back when you spoke to-night,
and I knew you must be Sheba.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew my name, but I did not know yours,&#8221; said
Sheba. &#8220;But, after all,&#8221; rather as if consoling herself,
&#8220;Sheba is not my real name. I have another one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked the young fellow, quite eagerly.
His eyes had scarcely left her face an instant. She was
standing by Tom&#8217;s chair and her hands were on his shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Felicia,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Uncle Tom gave it to me&mdash;because
he wanted me to be happy.&#8221; And she curved a
slim arm round Tom&#8217;s neck and kissed him.
</p>
<p>It was the simplest, prettiest thing a man could have seen.
Her life had left her nature as pure and translucent as the
clearest brook. She had had no one to compare herself
with or to be made ashamed or timid by. She knew only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
her own heart and Tom&#8217;s love, and she smiled as radiantly
into the lighting face before her as she would have smiled
at a rose, or at a young deer she had met in the woods.
No one had ever looked at her in this way before, but being
herself a thing which had grown like a flower, she felt no
shyness, and was only glad. Eve might have smiled at Adam
so in their first hours.
</p>
<p>Big Tom, sitting between them, saw it all. A man cannot
live a score of years and more, utterly cut off from the life
of the world, without having many a long hour for thought
in which he will inevitably find himself turning over the
problems which fill the life he has missed. Tom De Willoughby
had had many of them. He had had no one to
talk to whose mind could have worked with his own. On
winter nights, when Sheba had been asleep, he had found
himself gazing into the red embers of his wood fire and
pondering on the existence he might have led if fate had
been good to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be happiness on the earth somewhere,&#8221; he
would say. &#8220;Somewhere there ought to have been a woman
I belonged to, and who belonged to me. It ought all to
have been as much nature as the rain falling and the corn
ripening in the sun. If we had met when we were young
things&mdash;on the very brink of it all&mdash;and smiled into each
other&#8217;s eyes and taken each other&#8217;s hands, and kissed each
other&#8217;s lips, we might have ripened together like the corn.
What is it that&#8217;s gone wrong?&#8221; All the warm normal affections
of manhood, which might have remained undeveloped
and been cast away, had been lavished on the child Sheba.
She had represented his domestic circle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mayn&#8217;t know it, Sheba,&#8221; he had said once to her,
&#8220;but you&#8217;re a pretty numerous young person. You&#8217;re a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
man&#8217;s wife and family, and mother and sisters, and at least
half a dozen boys and girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All his thoughts had concentrated themselves upon her&mdash;all
his psychological problems had held her as their centre,
all his ethical reasonings had applied themselves to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got to be happy,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;and she&#8217;s
got to be strong enough to stand up under unhappiness, if&mdash;if
I should be taken away from her. When the great thing
that&#8217;s&mdash;that&#8217;s the meaning of it all&mdash;and the reason of it&mdash;comes
into her life, it ought to come as naturally as summer
does. If her poor child of a mother&mdash;Good Lord! Good
Lord!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And here he sat in the moonlight, and Delia Vanuxem&#8217;s
son was looking at her with ardent, awakened young eyes.
</p>
<p>How she listened as Rupert told his story, and how sweetly
she was moved by the pathos of it. Once or twice she made
an involuntary movement forward, as if she was drawn towards
him, and uttered a lovely low exclamation which was
a little like the broken coo of a dove. Rupert did not know
that there was pathos in his relation. He made only a simple
picture of things, but as he went on Tom saw all the effect
of the hot little town left ruined and apathetic after the
struggle of war, the desolateness of the big house empty but
for its three rooms, its bare floors echoing to the sound of
the lonely pair of feet, the garden grown into a neglected
jungle, the slatternly negro girl in the kitchen singing wild
camp-meeting hymns as she went about her careless work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds so lonely,&#8221; Sheba said, with tender mournfulness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was what it was&mdash;lonely,&#8221; Rupert answered. &#8220;It&#8217;s
been a different place since Matt came, but it has always
been lonely. Uncle Tom,&#8221; putting his hand on the big knee
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
near him, as impulsively as a child, &#8220;I love that old Matt&mdash;I
love him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, so do I!&#8221; burst forth Sheba. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you, Uncle
Tom?&#8221; And she put her hand on the other knee.
</p>
<p>Rupert looked down at the hand. It was so fair and soft
and full of the expression of sympathy&mdash;such an adorably
womanly little hand, that one&#8217;s first impulse was to lay
one&#8217;s own upon it. He made a movement and then remembered,
and looked up, and their eyes met and rested on
each other gently.
</p>
<p>When the subject of the claim was broached, Sheba
thought it like a fairy tale. She listened almost with bated
breath. As Rupert had not realised that he was pathetic
in the relation of the first part of his story, so he did not
know that he was picturesque in this. But his material had
strong colour. The old man on the brink of splendid fortune,
the strange, unforeseen national disaster sweeping all
before it and leaving only poverty and ruin, the untouched
wealth of the mines lying beneath the earth on which battles
had been fought&mdash;all the possibilities the future might hold
for one penniless boy&mdash;these things were full of suggestion
and excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would be rich,&#8221; said Sheba.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So would Uncle Tom,&#8221; Rupert answered, smiling; &#8220;and
you, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom had been listening with a reflective look on his face.
He tilted his chair back and ran his hand through his hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At all events, we couldn&#8217;t <i>lose</i> money if we didn&#8217;t gain
any,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re safe. When a man&#8217;s
got to the place where he hasn&#8217;t anything to lose, he can
afford to take chances. Perhaps it&#8217;s worth thinking over.
Let&#8217;s go to bed, children. It&#8217;s midnight.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>When they said good-night to each other, the two young
hands clung together kindly and Sheba looked up with
sympathetic eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to be very rich?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night I am rich,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;That is because
you and Uncle Tom have made me feel as if I belonged
to someone. It is so long since I have seemed to belong
to anyone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But now you belong to us,&#8221; said Sheba.
</p>
<p>He stood silently looking down at her a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your eyes look just as they did when you were a little
child,&#8221; he said. He lifted her hand and pressed his warm
young lips to it.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p>He awoke the next morning with a glow in his heart
which should not be new to youth, but was new to him.
He remembered feeling something rather like it years before
when he had been a little boy and had wakened on the
morning of his birthday and found his mother kissing him
and his bed strewn with gifts.
</p>
<p>He went downstairs and, strolling on to the porch, saw
Sheba in the garden. As he went to join her, he found
himself in the midst of familiar paths and growths.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he exclaimed, stopping before her, &#8220;it is the
old garden!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Sheba answered; &#8220;Uncle Tom made it like this
because he loved the other one. You and I have played in
the same garden. Good-morning,&#8221; laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is a good-morning. I&mdash;somehow
I have been thinking that when I woke I felt
as I used to do when I was a child and woke on my birthday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That morning she showed him her domain. To the imaginative
boy she led with her, she seemed like a strange
young princess, to whom all the land belonged. She loved
it so and knew so well all it yielded. She showed him the
cool woods where she always found the first spring flowers,
the chestnut and walnut trees where she and Tom gathered
their winter supply of nuts, the places where the wild grapes
grew thickest, and those where the ground was purple-carpeted
with violets.
</p>
<p>They wandered on together until they reached a hollow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
in the road, on one side of which a pine wood sloped up
a hillside, looking dark and cool.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I come here very often,&#8221; she said, quite simply. &#8220;My
mother is here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he saw that a little distance above the road a deserted
log cabin stood, and not far from it two or three pine trees
had been cut down so that the sun could shine on a mound
over and about which flowers grew. It was like a little garden
in the midst of the silent wildness.
</p>
<p>He followed her to the pretty spot, and she knelt down
by it and removed a leaf or a dead flower here and there.
The little mound was a snowy mass of white blossoms standing
thick together, and for a yard or so about the earth was
starred with the same flowers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Uncle Tom and I plant new flowers
for every month. Everything is always white. Sometimes
it is all lilies of the valley or white hyacinths, and then it
is white roses, and in the autumn white chrysanthemums.
Uncle Tom thought of it when I was a little child, and we
have done it together ever since. We think she knows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stopped, and, still kneeling, looked at him as if suddenly
remembering something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not heard,&#8221; she said; &#8220;she died when I was
born, and we do not even know her name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not her name!&#8221; Rupert said; but the truth was that
he had heard more of the story than she had.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My father was so stunned with grief, that Uncle Tom
said he seemed to think of nothing but that he could not
bear to stay. He went away the very night they laid her
here. I suppose,&#8221; she said slowly, and looking at the mass
of white narcissus instead of at him, &#8220;I suppose when people
love each other, and one dies, the other cannot&mdash;cannot&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>Rupert saw that she was unconsciously trying to explain
something to herself, and he interposed between her and
her thoughts with a hurried effort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it must be so. When they love each
other and one is taken, how <i>can</i> the other bear it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she lifted her eyes from the flowers to his again,
and they looked very large and bright.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she said, in an unsteady little voice, &#8220;I had
only been alive a few hours when he went away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly the brightness in her eyes welled up and fell in
two large crystal drops, though a smile quivered on her lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell Uncle Tom,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I never let him know
that it&mdash;it hurts my feelings when I think I had only been
alive such a few hours&mdash;and there was nobody to care. I
must have been so little. If&mdash;if there had been no Uncle
Tom&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He knelt down by her side and took her hand in his.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there was,&#8221; he said; &#8220;there was!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, her sweet face trembling with emotion;
&#8220;and, oh! I love him so! I love him so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She put her free hand on the earth among the white
flowers on the mound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I love her, too,&#8221; she said; &#8220;somehow I know she
would not have forgotten me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, she would not!&#8221; Rupert cried; and they knelt
together, hand in hand, looking into each other&#8217;s eyes as
tenderly as children.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been lonelier than you,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I have had
nobody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother died, too, when you were very young?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Sheba,&#8221; hesitating a moment. &#8220;I will tell you
something.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom loved her. He left his home partly because
he could not stay and see her marry a man who&mdash;did not
deserve her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she marry someone like that?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>His forehead flushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She married my father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and he was a drunken
maniac and broke her heart. I saw it break. When I first
remember her, she was a lovely young girl with eyes like
a gazelle&#8217;s&mdash;and she cried all their beauty away, and grew
tired and old and haggard before I was twelve. He is dead,
but I hate him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said; &#8220;you have been lonely!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been something worse than that!&#8221; he answered,
and the gloom came back to his face. &#8220;I have been afraid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid!&#8221; said Sheba. &#8220;Of what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I might end like him. How do I know? It is in
my blood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have nearly all been like that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was
the maddest of them all, but he was only like many of the
others. We grow tall, we De Willoughbys, we have black
eyes, we drink and we make ourselves insane with morphine.
It&#8217;s a ghastly thing to think of,&#8221; he shuddered. &#8220;When
I am lonely, I think of it night and day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&mdash;I will help you to forget
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have often wondered if there was anyone who could,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;I think perhaps you might.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When they returned to the Cross-roads there were several
customers loitering on the post-office porch, awaiting their
arrival, and endeavouring to wear an air of concealing no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
object whatever. The uneventful lives they led year after
year made men and women alike avid for anything of the
nature of news or incident. In some mysterious way the air
itself seemed to communicate to them anything of interest
which might be impending. Big Tom had not felt inclined
to be diffuse on the subject of the arrival of his nephew, but
each customer who brought in a pail of butter or eggs, a
roll of jeans or a pair of chickens, seemed to become enlightened
at once as to the position of affairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye see,&#8221; Tom heard Doty confiding to a friend as
they sat together outside a window of the store; &#8220;ye see,
it&#8217;s this way&mdash;the D&#8217;Willerbys was born &#8217;ristycrats. I dunno
as ye&#8217;d think it to look at Tom. Thar&#8217;s a heap <i>to</i> Tom,
but he ain&#8217;t <i>my</i> idee of a &#8217;ristycrat. My idee is thet mebbe
he let out from D&#8217;lisleville kase he warn&#8217;t &#8217;ristycratic enough
fur &#8217;em. Thar wus a heap of property in the family, &#8217;pears
like. An&#8217; now the hull lot of &#8217;em&#8217;s dead &#8217;cept this yere boy
that come last night. Stamps hes seen him in D&#8217;lisleville,
an&#8217; he says he&#8217;s a-stavin&#8217; lookin&#8217; young feller, an&#8217; thet thar&#8217;s
somethin&#8217; about a claim on the Guv&#8217;ment thet ef Tom an&#8217;
him don&#8217;t foller up, they&#8217;re blamed fools. Now Tom, he
ain&#8217;t no blamed fool. Fur <i>not</i> bein&#8217; a blamed fool, I&#8217;ll back
Tom agin any man in Hamlin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So, when the two young figures were seen sauntering along
the road towards the store, there were lookers-on enough to
regard them with interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now <i>he&#8217;s</i> my idee of a &#8217;ristycrat,&#8221; remarked Mr. Doty,
with the manner of a connoisseur. &#8220;Kinder tall an&#8217; slim,
an&#8217; high-sperrity lookin&#8217;; Sheby&#8217;s a gal, but she&#8217;s got it too&mdash;thet
thar sorter racehorse look. Now, hain&#8217;t she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to see the store and the people in it,&#8221; Sheba
was saying. &#8220;It&#8217;s my home, you know. Uncle Tom took
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
me there the day after I was born. I used to play on the
floor behind the counter and near the stove, and all those
men are my friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert had never before liked anything so much as he
liked the simple lovingness of this life of hers. As she knew
the mountains, the flowers, and the trees, she knew and
seemed known by the very cows and horses and people she
saw.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s John Hutton&#8217;s old gray horse,&#8221; she had said
as she caught sight of one rider in the distance. &#8220;That is
Billy Neil&#8217;s yoke of oxen,&#8221; at another time. &#8220;Good-morning,
Mrs. Stebbins,&#8221; she called out, with the prettiest possible
cheer, to a woman in an orange cotton skirt as she
passed on the road. &#8220;It seems to me sometimes,&#8221; she said
to Rupert, &#8220;as if I belonged to a family that was scattered
over miles and lived in scores of houses. They all used to
tell Uncle Tom what would disagree with me when I was
cutting my teeth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They mounted the steps of the porch, laughing the light,
easy laugh of youth, and the loiterers regarded them with
undisguised interest and admiration. In her pink cotton
frock, and blooming like a rose in the shade of her frilled
pink sunbonnet, Sheba was fair to see. Rupert presented
an aspect which was admirably contrasting. His cool pallor
and dense darkness of eyes and hair seemed a delightful
background to her young tints of bloom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet thar white linen suit o&#8217; his&#8217;n,&#8221; Mr. Doty said,
&#8220;might hev been put on a-purpose to kinder set off her
looks as well as his&#8217;n.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was to Mr. Doty Sheba went first.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake,&#8221; she said, &#8220;this is my cousin Mr. Rupert De Willoughby
from Delisleville.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty glad to be made &#8217;quainted, sir,&#8221; said Jake.
&#8220;Tom&#8217;s mightily sot up at yer comin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They all crowded about him and went through the same
ceremony. It could scarcely be called a ceremony, it was
such a simple and actually affectionate performance. It was
so plain that his young good looks and friendly grace of
manner reached their hearts at once, and that they were
glad that he had come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They <i>are</i> glad you have come,&#8221; Sheba said afterwards.
&#8220;You are from the world over there, you know,&#8221; waving
her hand towards the blue of the mountains. &#8220;We are all
glad when we see anything from the outside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to go there?&#8221; Rupert asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, with a little nod of her head. &#8220;If
Uncle Tom will go&mdash;and you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They spent almost an hour in the store holding a sort of
<i>levée</i>. Every newcomer bade the young fellow welcome and
seemed to accept him as a sort of boon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a mighty good-lookin&#8217; young feller,&#8221; they all said,
and the women added: &#8220;Them black eyes o&#8217; his&#8217;n an&#8217; the
way his hair kinks is mighty purty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Their feelings will be hurt if you don&#8217;t stay a little,&#8221;
said Sheba. &#8220;They want to look at you. You don&#8217;t mind
it, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, laughing; &#8220;it delights me. No one
ever wanted to look at me before. But I should hardly think
they would want to look at me when they might look at
you instead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have looked at me for eighteen years,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;They looked at me when I had the measles, and
saw me turn purple when I had the whooping-cough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they were going away, they passed a little man who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
had just arrived and was hitching to the horse-rail a raw-boned
&#8220;clay-bank&#8221; mare. He looked up as they neared
him and smiled peacefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy?&#8221; he said to Rupert. &#8220;Ye hain&#8217;t seen me afore,
but I seen you when I was to Delisleville. It wuz me as
told yer nigger ye&#8217;d be a fool if ye didn&#8217;t get Tom ter help
yer to look up thet thar claim. Ye showed horse sense by
comin&#8217;. Wish ye luck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom,&#8221; said Sheba, as they sat at their dinner and
Mornin walked backwards and forwards from the kitchen
stove to the dining-room with chicken fried in cream, hot
biscuits, and baked yams, &#8220;we saw Mr. Stamps and he
wished us luck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has a claim himself, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; said Rupert. &#8220;He
told Matt it was for a yoke of oxen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom broke into a melodious roar of laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if we can do as well by ours as Stamps
will do by his, we shall be in luck. That yoke of oxen has
grown from a small beginning. If it thrives as it goes on,
the Government&#8217;s in for a big thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has grown from a calf,&#8221; said Sheba, &#8220;and it wasn&#8217;t
six weeks old.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A Government mule kicked it and broke its leg,&#8221; said
Tom. &#8220;Stamps made veal of it, and in two months it was
&#8216;Thet heifer o&#8217; mine&#8217;&mdash;in six months it was a young
steer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s a yoke of oxen,&#8221; said Rupert; &#8220;and they were
the pride of the county.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord! Lord!&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;the United States has got
something to engineer.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p>It was doubtless Stamps who explained the value of the
De Willoughby claim to the Cross-roads. Excited interest
in it mounted to fever heat in a few days. The hitching rail
was put to such active use that the horses shouldered each
other and occasionally bit and kicked and enlivened the air
with squeals. No one who had an opportunity neglected
to appear at the post-office, that he or she might hear the
news. Judge De Willoughby&#8217;s wealth and possessions increased
each time they were mentioned. The old De Willoughby
place became a sort of princely domain, the good
looks of the Judge&#8217;s sons and daughters and the splendour
of their gifts were spoken of almost with bated breath. The
coal mines became gold mines, the money invested in them
something scarcely to be calculated. The Government at
Washington, it was even inferred, had not money enough
in its treasury to refund what had been lost and indemnify
for the injury done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think o&#8217; Tom settin&#8217; gassin&#8217; yere with us fellers,&#8221;
they said, admiringly, &#8220;jest same es if he warn&#8217;t nothin&#8217;.
A-settin&#8217; in his shirt sleeves an&#8217; tradin&#8217; fer eggs an&#8217;
butter. Why, ef he puts thet thar claim through, he kin
buy up Hamlin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like ter see the way he&#8217;d fix up Sheby,&#8221; said Mis&#8217;
Doty. &#8220;He&#8217;d hev her dressed in silks an&#8217; satins&mdash;an&#8217; diamond
earrings soon as look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll hev to go ter Washin&#8217;ton City sure enough, Tom,&#8221;
was the remark made oftenest. &#8220;When do ye &#8217;low to start?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>But Tom was not as intoxicated by the prospect as the
rest of them. His demeanour was thoughtful and unexhilarated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whar do ye &#8217;low to build yer house when ye come into
yer money, Tom?&#8221; he was asked, gravely. &#8220;Shall ye hev
a cupoly? Whar&#8217;ll ye buy yer land?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The instinct of Hamlin County tended towards expressing
any sense of opulence by increasing the size of the house it
lived in, or by building a new one, and invariably by purchasing
land. Nobody had ever become rich in the neighbourhood,
but no imagination would have found it possible
to extend its efforts beyond a certain distance from the Cross-roads.
The point of view was wholly primitive and patriarchal.
</p>
<p>Big Tom was conscious that he had become primitive and
patriarchal also, though the truth was that he had always
been primitive.
</p>
<p>As he sat on the embowered porch of his house in the
evening and thought things over, while the two young voices
murmured near him, his reflections were not greatly joyful.
The years he had spent closed in by the mountains and surrounded
by his simple neighbours had been full of peace.
Since Sheba had belonged to him they had even held more
than peace. The end had been that the lonely unhappiness
of his youth had seemed a thing so far away that it was rather
like a dream. Only Delia Vanuxem was not quite like a
dream. Her pitying girlish face and the liquid darkness
of her uplifted eyes always came back to him clearly when
he called them up in thought. He called them up often
during these days in which he was pondering as to what
it was best to decide to do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the boy who brings her back so,&#8221; he told himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
&#8220;Good Lord, how near she seems! The grass has been growing
over her for many a year, and I&#8217;m an old fellow, but
she looks just as she did then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The world beyond the mountains did not allure him. It
was easier to sit and see the sun rise and set within the
purple boundary than to face life where it was less simple,
and perhaps less kindly. It was from a much less advanced
and concentrated civilisation he had fled in his youth, and
the years which had passed had not made him more fitted
to combat with what was more complex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trading for butter and eggs over the counter of a country
store, and discussing Doty&#8217;s corn crop and Hayworth&#8217;s
pigs hasn&#8217;t done anything particular towards fitting me to
shine in society,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It suits <i>me</i> well enough, but
it&#8217;s not what&#8217;s wanted at a ball or a cabinet minister&#8217;s reception.&#8221;
And he shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather stay where
I am&mdash;a darned sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the murmuring voices went on near him, and little
bursts of laughter rang out, or two figures wandered about
the garden, and his thoughts always came back to one point&mdash;a
point where the sun seemed to shine on things and
surround them with a dazzling radiance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s all very well for <i>me</i>,&#8221; he concluded more than
once. &#8220;It&#8217;s well enough for <i>me</i> to sit down and spend the
rest of my life looking at the mountains and watching summer
change into winter; but they are only beginning it all&mdash;just
beginning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So one night he left his chair and went out and walked
between them in the moonlight, a hand resting on a shoulder
of each.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want you two to help me to make up
my mind.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About going away?&#8221; asked Rupert, looking round at
him quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Do you know we may have a pretty hard time?
We&#8217;ve no money. We should have to live scant enough, and,
unless we had luck, we might come back here worse off than
we left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we should have tried, and we should have been
on the other side of the mountains,&#8221; said Sheba.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So we should,&#8221; said Tom, reflectively. &#8220;And there&#8217;s a
good deal in seeing the other side of the mountains when
people are young.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheba put her hand on his and looked at him with a glowing
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom,&#8221; she said, &#8220;oh, let us go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom,&#8221; said Rupert, &#8220;I <i>must</i> go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The line showed itself between his black brows again,
though it was not a frown. He put his hand in his pocket
and held it out, open, with a solitary twenty-dollar bill lying
in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and that&#8217;s borrowed. If
the claim is worth nothing, I must earn enough to pay it
back. All right. We&#8217;ll all three go,&#8221; said Tom.
</p>
<p>The next day he began to develop the plans he had been
allowing to form vaguely as a background to his thoughts.
They were not easy to carry out in the existing condition
of general poverty. But at Lucasville, some forty miles distant,
he was able to raise a mortgage on his land.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the worst comes to the worst,&#8221; he said to Sheba,
&#8220;after we have seen the other side of the mountains, do you
think you could stand it to come back and live with me in
the rooms behind the store?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheba sat down upon his knee and put her arms round
his neck, as she had done when she was ten years old.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I could live with you anywhere,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The only
thing I couldn&#8217;t stand would be to have to live away from
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom laughed and kissed her. He laughed that he might
smother a sigh. Rupert was standing near and looking at
her with the eyes that were so like Delia Vanuxem&#8217;s.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p>For an imaginative or an untravelled person to approach
the city of Washington at sunrise on a radiant morning, is
a thing far from unlikely to be remembered, since a white
and majestic dome, rising about a white structure set high
and supported by stately colonnades, the whole gleaming fair
against a background of blue sky, forms a picture which does
not easily melt away.
</p>
<p>Those who reared this great temple of white stone and
set it on a hilltop to rule and watch over the land, builded
better than they knew. To the simple and ardent idealist
its white stateliness must always suggest something symbolic,
and, after all, it is the ardent and simple idealist whose
dreams and symbols paint to prosaic human minds the beautiful
impossibilities whose unattainable loveliness so allures
as to force even the unexalted world into the endeavour to
create such reproductions of their forms as crude living will
allow.
</p>
<p>Tom leaned against the side of the car window and
watched the great dome with an air of curious reflection.
Sheba and Rupert leaned forward and gazed at it with dreaming
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as the capitol of a great republic ought to look,&#8221;
Rupert said. &#8220;Spotless and majestic, and as if it dominated
all it looks down upon with pure laws and dignity and
justice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Tom.
</p>
<p>In the various crises of political excitement in Hamlin
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
County he had taken the part of an unbiassed but humorous
observer, and in that character had gained much experience
of a primitive kind. What he had been led chiefly to
remark in connection with the &#8220;great republic&#8221; was that
the majesty and spotlessness of its intentions were not invariably
realised by mere human units.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, as he took down his valise from the
rack, &#8220;we&#8217;re coming in here pretty well fixed for leaving the
place millionaires. If we had only fifteen cents in our
pockets, it would be a dead sure thing, according to all the
biographers <i>I</i> ever read. The only thing against us is that
we have a little more&mdash;but it&#8217;s not enough to spoil our luck,
that I&#8217;ll swear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was not without reason in the statement. Few voyagers
on the ocean of chance could have dared the journey
with less than they had in their possession.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve got to do,&#8221; he had said to Rupert, &#8220;is to
take care of Sheba. We two can rough it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked through the awakening city, finding it
strange and bare with its broad avenues and streets ill-paved,
bearing traces everywhere of the tragedy of war
through which it had passed. The public buildings alone
had dignity; for the rest, it wore a singularly provincial and
uncompleted aspect; its plan was simple and splendid in
its vistas and noble spaces, but the houses were irregular
and without beauty of form; negro shanties huddled against
some of the most respectable, and there were few whose
windows or doors did not announce that board and lodging
might be obtained within. There was no look of well-being
or wealth anywhere; the few equipages in the streets had
seen hard service; the people who walked were either plainly
dressed or shabby genteel; about the doors of the principal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
hotels there were groups of men who wore, most of them,
dispirited or anxious faces. Ten years later the whole aspect
of the place was changing, but at this time it was passing
through a period of natural fatigue and poverty, and was
not an inspiring spectacle to penniless new-comers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It reminds me a little of Delisleville, after all,&#8221; said
Rupert.
</p>
<p>Beyond the more frequented quarters of the town, they
found broad, unkempt, and as yet unlevelled avenues and
streets, where modest houses straggled, perched on high
banks with an air of having found themselves there quite
by accident. The banks were usually grass-covered, and
the white picket fences enclosed bits of ground where scant
fruit-trees and disorderly bushes grew; almost every house
possessed a porch, and almost every porch was scrambled over
by an untidy honeysuckle or climbing rose which did its best
to clothe with some grace the dilapidated woodwork and the
peeled and blistered paint.
</p>
<p>Before one of these houses Tom stopped to look at a lopsided
sign in the little garden, which announced that rooms
were to be rented within.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we can find something here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that
may suit the first ventures of millionaires. It&#8217;s the sort of
thing that will appeal to the newspaper man who writes
the thing up; &#8216;First home of the De Willoughbys when
they arrived in Washington to look up their claim.&#8217; It&#8217;ll
make a good woodcut to contrast with &#8216;The great De
Willoughby mansion in Fifth Avenue. Cost five hundred
thousand!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>They mounted the wooden steps built into the bank
and knocked at the door. Rupert and Sheba exchanged
glances with a little thrill. They were young enough to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
feel a sort of excitement even in taking this first modest
step.
</p>
<p>A lady with a gentle, sallow face and a faded black cotton
gown, opened the door. Her hair hung in depressed but
genteel ringlets on each side of her countenance; at the
back it formed a scant coil upheld by a comb. Tom thought
he observed a gleam of hope in her eye when she saw them.
She spoke with the accent of Virginia.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, suh, we have rooms disengaged. Won&#8217;t you come
in?&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>She led them into a neat but rather painful little parlour.
The walls were decorated with photographs of deceased relatives
in oval frames, and encased in glass there was a floral
wreath made of hair of different shades and one of white,
waxen-looking flowers, with a vaguely mortuary suggestion
in their arrangement. There was a basket of wax fruit under
a shade on the centre table, a silver ice-water pitcher on a
salver, and two photograph albums whose binding had become
loosened by much handling. There was also a book
with a red and gold cover, bearing in ornate letters the title
&#8220;Life of General Robert Lee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The rooms are not lawge,&#8221; the lady said, &#8220;but they are
furnished with the things I brought from my fawther&#8217;s house
in Virginia. My fawther was Judge Burford, of the Burford
family of England. There&#8217;s a Lord Burford in England,
we always heard. It is a very old family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked as if she found a vague comfort in the statement,
and Tom did not begrudge it to her. She looked very
worn and anxious, and he felt it almost possible that during
the last few months she might not always have had quite
enough to eat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thawt in the days when I was Judge Burford&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
dawtah of Burfordsville,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;that I should
come to Washington to take boarders. There was a time
when it was thawt in Virginia that Judge Burford might
reach the White House if he would allow himself to be nominated.
It&#8217;s a great change of circumstances. Did you want
board with the rooms?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Tom.
</p>
<p>She interrupted him in some little hurry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it wouldn&#8217;t be convenient for me to board
anyone,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I&#8217;ve not been accustomed to providing
for boarders, and I&#8217;m not conveniently situated. If&mdash;if you
preferred to economize&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We do,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;We have come to look up a claim,
and people on that business are pretty safe to have to economize,
I&#8217;ve been told!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, a claim!&#8221; she ejaculated, with combined interest
and reverence. &#8220;Indeed, you are quite right about its being
necessary to economize. Might I enqu&#8217;ah if it is a large
one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is,&#8221; Tom answered; &#8220;and it&#8217;s not likely
to be put through in a month, and we have not money
enough to keep us in luxury for much more. Probably we
shall be able to make it last longer if we take rooms and buy
our own food.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you would, suh,&#8221; she answered, with a little
eager flush on her cheek. &#8220;When people provide for themselves,
they can sometimes do without&mdash;things.&#8221; She added
the last word hurriedly and gave a little cough which sounded
nervous.
</p>
<p>It was finally agreed that they should take three little
rooms she showed them, in one of which there was a tiny
stove, upon which they could prepare such simple food as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
they could provide themselves with. The arrangement was
not a luxurious one, but it proved to be peculiarly suitable
to the owners of the great De Willoughby claim.
</p>
<p>As they had not broken fast, Tom went out to explore
the neighbourhood in search of food. He thought he remembered
having seen in a side street a little store. When
he returned, after some wanderings, a wood fire was crackling
in the stove and Sheba had taken off her hat and put
on a white apron.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I borrowed it from Miss Burford,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I went
down to see her. She let us have the wood, too. Rupert
made the fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took the paper bags from Tom&#8217;s hands and stood on
tiptoe to kiss him, smiling sweetly at his rather troubled
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All my life you have been doing things for me. Now
it is my turn,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have watched Mornin ever since
I was born. I am going to be your servant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In an hour from the time they had taken possession
of their quarters, they were sitting at a little table before
an open window, making a breakfast of coffee and eggs.
Sheba was presiding, and both men were looking at her
flushed cheeks adoringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the coffee good, Uncle Tom?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Just tell
me it is good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;for the first effort of a millionairess,
I should say it was.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p>The year before this Judge Rutherford had been sent
to Congress by the Republican Party of Hamlin County.
His election had been a wildly exciting and triumphant one.
Such fiery eloquence as his supporters displayed had rarely,
if ever, been poured forth before. It was proved by each
orator that the return of the Democratic candidate would
plunge the whole country into the renewal of bloodshed and
war. This catastrophe having been avoided by the Judge&#8217;s
election, the nation&mdash;as represented by Hamlin County&mdash;had
settled down with prospects of peace, prosperity, and
the righting of all old grievances. The Judge bought a new
and shining valise, a new and shining suit of broadcloth,
and a silk hat equally shining and new, and went triumphantly
to Washington, the sole drawback to his exultation
being that he was obliged to leave Jenny behind him with
the piano, the parlour furniture, and the children.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;ll hev ye thar in the White House, ef ye give
him time,&#8221; said an ardent constituent who called to congratulate.
</p>
<p>There seemed no end to a political career begun under
such auspices but the executive mansion itself. The confidence
of the rural communities in their representatives was
great and respectful. It was believed that upon their arrival
at the capital, business in both Houses was temporarily postponed
until it had been supported by their expression of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
opinion and approval. It was believed also that the luxury
and splendour of a Congressman&#8217;s life was such as ancient
Rome itself might have paled before and envied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A man in Washin&#8217;ton city with a Congristman&#8217;s wages
has got to be a purty level-headed feller not to get into
high-falutin&#8217; ways of livin&#8217; an&#8217; throwin&#8217; money about.
He&#8217;s got to keep in his mind that this yere&#8217;s a republic
an&#8217; not a &#8217;ristycratic, despotic monarchy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was a sentiment often expressed, and Tom De Willoughby
himself had had vaguely respectful views of the circumstances
and possible surroundings of a representative of
his country.
</p>
<p>But when he made his first visit to Judge Rutherford,
he did not find him installed in a palatial hotel and surrounded
by pampered menials. He was sitting in a back
room in a boarding-house&mdash;a room which contained a folding
bedstead and a stove. He sat in a chair which was tilted
on its hind legs, and his feet rested on the stove&#8217;s ornamental
iron top. He had just finished reading a newspaper which
lay on the floor beside him, and his hands were thrust into
his pockets. He looked somewhat depressed in spirits.
</p>
<p>When Tom was ushered into the room, the Judge looked
round at him, uttered a shout of joy, and sprang to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; he cried out, falling upon him and shaking his
hand rather as if he would not object to shaking it off and
retaining it as an agreeable object forever. &#8220;Tom! Old
Tom! Jupiter, Tom! I don&#8217;t know how you got here or
where you came from, but&mdash;Jupiter! I&#8217;m glad to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went on shaking his hand as he dragged him across
the room and pushed him into a dingy armchair by the
window; and when he had got him there, he stood over him
grasping his shoulder, shaking his hand still. Tom saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
that his chin was actually twitching in a curious way which
made his goatee move unsteadily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The legislation of your country hasn&#8217;t made you forget
home folks, has it?&#8221; said Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget &#8217;em!&#8221; exclaimed the Judge, throwing himself
into a seat opposite and leaning forward excitedly with his
hands on his knees. &#8220;I never remembered anything in my
life as I remember them. They&#8217;re never out of my mind,
night or day. I&#8217;ve got into a way of dreaming I&#8217;m back
to Barnesville, talking to the boys at the post-office, or
listening to Jenny playing &#8216;Home, Sweet Home&#8217; or &#8216;The
Maiden&#8217;s Prayer.&#8217; I was a bit down yesterday and couldn&#8217;t
eat, and in the night there I was in the little dining-room,
putting away fried chicken and hot biscuits as fast as the
nigger girl could bring the dishes on the table. Good
Lord! how good they were! There&#8217;s nothing like them
in Washington city,&#8221; he added, and he heaved a big sigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, man,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;you&#8217;re homesick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Judge heaved another sigh, thrusting his hands
deeper into his pockets and looking out of the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, by Jingo!&#8221; he said; &#8220;that&#8217;s what I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He withdrew his gaze from the world outside the window
and returned to Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived different. When a man
has been born and brought up among the mountains and
lived a country life among folks that are all neighbours and
have neighbourly ways, city life strikes him hard. Politics
look different here; they <i>are</i> different. They&#8217;re not of the
neighbourly kind. Politicians ain&#8217;t joking each other and
having a good time. They don&#8217;t know anything about the
other man, and they don&#8217;t care a damn. What&#8217;s Hamlin
County to them? Why, they don&#8217;t know anything <i>about</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
Hamlin County, and, as far as I&#8217;ve got, they don&#8217;t want
to. They&#8217;ve got their own precincts to attend to, and they&#8217;re
going to do it. When a new man comes in, if he ain&#8217;t a
pretty big fellow that knows how to engineer things and
say things to make them listen to him, he&#8217;s only another
greenhorn. Now, I&#8217;m not a big fellow, Tom; I&#8217;ve found
that out! and the first two months after I came, blamed
if I wasn&#8217;t so homesick and discouraged that if it hadn&#8217;t
been for seeming to go back on the boys, durned if I don&#8217;t
believe I should have gone home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Big Tom sat and regarded his honest face thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re a bigger man than you know,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ll find that out in time, and perhaps other
people will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Judge shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not got education enough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I&#8217;m
not an orator. All there is to <i>me</i> is that I&#8217;m not going
back on the boys and Hamlin. I came here to do the square
thing by them and the United States, and blamed if I ain&#8217;t
going to do it as well as I know how.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look here,&#8221; said Big Tom, &#8220;that&#8217;s pretty good
politics to start with. If every man that came here came
to stand by his party&mdash;<i>and</i> the United States&mdash;and do the
square thing by them, the republic would be pretty safe,
if they couldn&#8217;t do another durned thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Judge rubbed his already rather rough head and
seemed to cheer up a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Big Tom stood up and gave him a slap on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think so?&#8221; he exclaimed, in his great, cheerful voice.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a greenhorn myself, but, good Lord! I <i>know</i> it. Making
laws for a few million people is a pretty big scheme, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
it&#8217;s the fellows who intend to do the square thing who are
going to put it through. This isn&#8217;t ancient Greece, or
Sparta, but it&#8217;s my impression that the men who planned
and wrote the Constitution, and did the thinking and orating
in those days, had a sort of idea of building up a thing
just as ornamental and good to write history about as either
one; and, what&#8217;s more, they counted on just such fellows
as you to go on carrying the stones and laying them plumb,
long after they were gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jupiter, Tom!&#8221; the Judge said, with something actually
like elation in his voice, &#8220;it&#8217;s good to hear you. It brings
old Hamlin back and gives a man sand. You&#8217;re an orator,
yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;No one ever called my attention
to it before. If it&#8217;s true, perhaps it&#8217;ll come in useful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, just think of me sitting here gassing,&#8221; exclaimed
the Judge, &#8220;and never asking what you are here for. What&#8217;s
your errand, Tom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;m here to defraud the Government,&#8221; Tom
answered, sitting down again; &#8220;or perhaps I&#8217;ve got a fair
claim against it. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve come to Washington to
find out&mdash;with the other claimant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A claim!&#8221; cried the Judge. &#8220;And you&#8217;ve left the
Cross-roads&mdash;and Sheba?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheba and the other claimant are in some little rooms
we&#8217;ve taken out near Dupont Circle. The other claimant is
the only De Willoughby left beside myself, and he is a
youngster of twenty-three. He&#8217;s my brother De Courcy&#8217;s
son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Judge glowed with interest. He heard the whole
story, and his excitement grew as he listened. The elements
of the picturesque in the situation appealed to him greatly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
The curiously composite mind of the American contains
a strong element of the romantic. In its most mercantile
forms it is attracted by the dramatic; when it hails from
the wilds, it is drawn by it as a child is drawn by colour
and light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big thing,&#8221; the Judge ejaculated at intervals.
&#8220;When I see you sitting there, Tom, just as you used to
sit in your chair on the store-porch, it seems as if it could
hardly be you that&#8217;s talking. Why, man, it&#8217;ll mean a
million!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I get money enough to set the mines at work,&#8221; said
Tom, &#8220;it may mean more millions than one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The dingy square room, with its worn carpet, its turned-up
bedstead, shabby chairs, and iron stove, temporarily assumed
a new aspect. That its walls should contain this fairy
tale of possible wealth and power and magnificence made
it seem quite soberly respectable, and that Big Tom, sitting
in the second-hand looking armchair, which creaked beneath
his weight, should, in matter-of-fact tones, be relating such
a story, made Judge Rutherford regard him with a kind of
reverent trouble.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheba, now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Sheba may be one of the biggest
heiresses in the States. Lord! what luck it was for
her that fellow left her behind!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was luck for me,&#8221; said Tom. And a faint, contemplative
grin showed itself on his countenance. He was
thinking, as he often did, of the afternoon when he returned
from Blair&#8217;s Hollow and opened the door of the room behind
the store to find the wooden cradle stranded like a small
ark in the corner.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p>Naturally Judge Rutherford gravitated towards the
little house near Dupont Circle. The first night he mounted
the stairs and found himself in the small room confronting
the primitive supper he had been invited to share with big
Tom and his family, his honest countenance assumed a
cheerfulness long a stranger to it.
</p>
<p>The room looked such a simple, homely place, with its
Virginia made carpet, its neat, scant furnishing, and its
table set with the plain little meal. The Judge&#8217;s homesick
heart expanded within him.
</p>
<p>He shook hands with Tom with fervour. Rupert he
greeted with friendly affection. Sheba&mdash;on her entering
the room with a plate of hot biscuits which she had been
baking in Miss Burford&#8217;s stove&mdash;he almost kissed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now this is something like,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know
there was anything so like Barnesville in all Washington
city. And there wasn&#8217;t till you people brought it. I don&#8217;t
know what it is, but, by thunder, it does a man&#8217;s heart good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat down with the unconventional air of ease he wore
in Barnesville when he established himself in one of Jenny&#8217;s
parlour chairs for the evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, Lord!&#8221; he said; &#8220;you&#8217;re home folks, and you&#8217;ve
got home ways, that&#8217;s what it is. A month in one of these
fashionable hotels would just about kill me. Having to
order things written out on a card and eat &#8217;em with a hundred
folks looking on&mdash;there&#8217;s no comfort in it. Give me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
a place where you can all sit up together round the table
and smell the good hot coffee and biscuit cooking and the
ham and chicken being fried in the kitchen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheba had cooked the supper in Miss Burford&#8217;s kitchen.
Her hot biscuits and coffee were made after Mornin&#8217;s most
respected recipes, and her housewifely air was tenderly
anxious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is not very good, Judge Rutherford,&#8221; she said,
standing shyly at the head of the table before she took
her place, &#8220;it is because I am only learning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have learned, Sheba,&#8221; said the Judge, looking at
the plate of light golden brown and cream white biscuit
with the sensitive eye of a connoisseur. &#8220;That plate of
biscuit is Barnesville and Sophrony all over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheba blushed with joy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Tom,&#8221; she said; &#8220;do you think it is? I
should so like to remind him of Barnesville.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; said the Judge. &#8220;Fact is, you&#8217;ve made
me feel already as if Tom Scott might break out yelling
in the back yard any minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After the supper was over and the table clear the party
of four sat down to talk business and make plans. The
entire inexperience of the claimants was an obstacle in their
path, but Judge Rutherford, though not greatly wiser than
themselves, had means of gaining information which would
be of value. As he looked over the papers and learned the
details of the story, the good fellow&#8217;s interest mounted to
excitement. He rubbed his head and grew flushed and
bright of eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jupiter, Tom!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I believe I can be
of some use to you&mdash;I swear I believe I can. I haven&#8217;t had
much experience, but I&#8217;ve seen something of this claim business,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
and if I set my wits to work I can find out from other
fellows who know more. I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221; After a moment&#8217;s reflection.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a talk with Farquhar to-morrow. That&#8217;s
what I&#8217;ll do. Great Scott!&#8221; in a beaming outburst, &#8220;if
I could push it through for you, how pleased Jenny would
be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he went away Tom accompanied him downstairs.
Sheba and Rupert followed them, and all three found themselves
lured out into the moonlit night to saunter with him
a few yards down the light avenue, talking still about their
fairy story. The Judge himself was as fascinated by it as
if he had been a child.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s such a good story to tell,&#8221; he expatiated; &#8220;and
there must be a great deal in that. I never heard a better
story for gaining sympathy&mdash;that fine old Southern aristocrat
standing by the Union in a red-hot secessionist town&mdash;actually
persecuted on account of it. He <i>was</i> persecuted,
wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; he enquired of Rupert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Rupert answered, &#8220;everybody was furious at
him, of course&mdash;all his friends. People who had known him
all his life passed him in the street without speaking. He&#8217;d
been very popular, and he felt it terribly. He never was
the same man after it began. He was old, and his spirit
gave way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so!&#8221; exclaimed the Judge, stopping upon the pavement,
elated even to oratory by the picture presented.
&#8220;Fine old Southern aristocrat&mdash;on the brink of magnificent
fortune&mdash;property turned into money that he may realise it&mdash;war
breaks out, ruins him&mdash;Spartan patriotism&mdash;one
patriot in a town of rebels hated and condemned by everybody&mdash;but
faithful to his country. Friends&mdash;<i>old</i> friends&mdash;refuse
to recognise him. Fortune gone&mdash;friends lost&mdash;heart
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
broken.&#8221; He snatched Tom&#8217;s big hand and shook it enthusiastically.
&#8220;Tom!&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;d like to make a speech to
the House about it myself. I believe they would listen to
me. How set up Jenny would be&mdash;how set up she&#8217;d be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He left them all in a glow of enthusiasm; they could see
him gesticulating a little to himself as he walked down the
avenue in the moonlight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just like him,&#8221; said Tom; &#8220;he&#8217;d rather please
Jenny than set the House of Representatives on fire. And
he&#8217;d undertake the whole thing&mdash;work to give a man a
fortune for mere neighbourliness. We were a neighbourly
lot in Hamlin, after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Judge went home to his boarding-house and sat late
in his shabby armchair, his legs stretched out, his hands
clasped on the top of his rough head. He was thinking the
thing out, and as he thought it out his excitement grew.
Sometimes he unclasped his hands and rubbed his hair with
restless sigh; more than once he unconsciously sprang to
his feet, walked across the floor two or three times, and
then sat down again. He was not a sharp schemer, he had
not even reached the stage of sophistication which would
have suggested to him that sharp scheming might be a
necessary adjunct in the engineering of such matters as
Government claims. From any power or tendency to diplomatise
he was as free as the illustrative bull in a china shop.
His bucolic trust in the simple justice and honest disinterestedness
of the political representatives of his native land
(it being granted they were of the Republican party) might
have appeared a touching thing to a more astute and experienced
person who had realised it to its limits. When
he rubbed his hair excitedly or sprang up to walk about,
these manifestations were indications, not of doubt or distrust,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
but of elated motion. It was the emotional aspect
of the situation which delighted and disturbed him, the dramatic
picturesqueness of it. Here was Tom&mdash;good old Tom&mdash;all
Hamlin knew Tom and his virtues and witticisms&mdash;Lord!
there wasn&#8217;t a man in the county who didn&#8217;t love
him&mdash;yes, <i>love</i> him. And here was Sheba that Tom had
been a father to. And what a handsome little creature
she&#8217;d grown into&mdash;and, but for Tom, the Lord knew what
would have become of her. And there was that story of
the De Willoughbys of Delisleville&mdash;handsome, aristocratic
lot, among the biggest bugs in the State&mdash;the fine old
Judge with his thousands of acres lying uncultivated, and
he paying his taxes on them through sheer patriarchal
pleasure in being a big landowner. For years the Government
had benefited by his tax-paying, while he had
gained nothing. And then there was the accidental discovery
of the splendid wealth hidden in the bowels of the earth&mdash;and
the old aristocrat&#8217;s energy and enterprise. Why, if
the war had not brought ruin to him and he had carried
out his plans, the whole State would have been the richer
for his mines. Capital would have been drawn in, labour
would have been in demand&mdash;things would have developed&mdash;outsiders
would have bought land&mdash;new discoveries would
have been made&mdash;the wealth of the country&#8217;s resources
would have opened up&mdash;the Government itself would have
benefited by the thing. And then the war had ruined all.
And yet the old Judge, overwhelmed with disaster as he
was, had stood by the Government and had been scorned
and deserted, and had died broken-hearted at the end,
and here were his sole descendants&mdash;good old Tom and his
little beauty of a protégée&mdash;(no, Sheba wasn&#8217;t a descendant,
but somehow she counted), and this fine young De Willoughby&mdash;all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
of them penniless. Why, the justice of the
thing stared a man in the face; a claim like that <i>must</i> go
through.
</p>
<p>At this juncture of his thought Judge Rutherford was
standing upright in the middle of his room. His hair was
in high disorder and his countenance flushed. He struck
his right fist hard against the palm of his left hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the whole thing&#8217;s as straight as a string,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s got to go through. I&#8217;ll go and see Farquhar to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Farquhar was a cleverer man than the representative from
Hamlin County. He had been returned several times by his
constituents, and his life had been spent in localities more
allied to effete civilization than was Barnesville. He knew
his Washington and had an astute interest in the methods
and characteristics of new members of Congress, particularly
perhaps such as the rural districts loomed up behind as a
background. Judge Rutherford he had observed at the outset
of his brief career, in the days when he had first appeared
in the House of Representatives in his new broadcloth with
its new creases, and with the uneasy but conscientious expression
in his eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good fellow, I should say,&#8221; he had remarked to
the member at the desk next to him. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t know what
to do, exactly&mdash;isn&#8217;t quite sure what he has come for&mdash;but
means to accomplish it, whatsoever it may turn out to be,
to the best of his ability. He&#8217;d be glad to make friends.
He&#8217;s used to neighbours and unceremonious intimacies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made friends with him himself and found the acquaintance
of interest at times. The faithfully reproduced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
atmosphere of Barnesville had almost a literary colour.
Occasionally, though not frequently, he encouraged delineation
of Jenny and Tom Scott and Thacker and &#8220;the
boys.&#8221; He had even inhaled at a distance vague whiffs of
Sophronia&#8217;s waffles.
</p>
<p>On the morning after the evening spent at Dupont Circle
Judge Rutherford frankly buttonholed him in the lobby.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Farquhar,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m chock full of a story. It kept
me awake half the night. I want to ask your advice about
it. It&#8217;s about a claim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have let it keep you awake,&#8221; replied
Farquhar. &#8220;Claims are not novel enough. It&#8217;s my opinion
that Washington is more than half populated just now with
people who have come to present claims.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Judge Rutherford&#8217;s countenance fell a little as the countenance
of an enthusiast readily falls beneath the breath of
non-enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I guess there are plenty of them&mdash;but
there are not many like this. You never heard such
a story. It would be worth listening to, even if you were
in the humour to walk ten miles to kick a claim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Farquhar laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been in them, Guv&#8217;nor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The atmosphere
is heavy with carpet-baggers who all have a reason
for being paid for something by the Government. There&#8217;s
one of them now&mdash;that little Hoosier hanging about the
doorway. He&#8217;s from North Carolina, and wants pay for
a herd of cattle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the hall outside the lobby a little man stood gazing
with pale small eyes intent upon the enchanted space within.
He wore a suit of blue jeans evidently made in the domestic
circle. He scanned each member of Congress who went in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
or out, and his expression was a combination of furtive eagerness
and tentative appeal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;ve seen him before,&#8221; remarked Judge Rutherford,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t know him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been hanging about the place for weeks,&#8221; said
Farquhar. &#8220;He&#8217;s always in the strangers&#8217; gallery when
claims come up for discussion. He looks as if he&#8217;d be likely
to get what he has come for, Hoosier as he is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk to you about the De Willoughbys,&#8221; said
Rutherford. &#8220;I can&#8217;t rest until I&#8217;ve told someone about
it. I want you to advise me what to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Farquhar allowed himself to be led away into a more
secluded spot. He was not, it must be confessed, greatly
interested, but he was well disposed towards the member
from Hamlin and would listen. They sat down together in
one of the rooms where such talk might be carried on, and
the Judge forthwith plunged into his story.
</p>
<p>It was, as his own instincts had told him, a good story.
He was at once simple and ornate in the telling&mdash;simple
in his broad directness, and ornate in his dramatic and emotional
touches. He began with the picture of the De Willoughbys
of Delisleville&mdash;the autocratic and aristocratic
Judge, the two picturesque sons, and the big, unpicturesque
one who disappeared from his native town to reappear in
the mountains of North Carolina and live his primitive life
there as the object of general adulation. He unconsciously
made Big Tom the most picturesque figure of the lot. Long
before he had finished sketching him, Farquhar&mdash;who had
been looking out of the window&mdash;turned his face towards
him. He began to feel himself repaid for his amiable if
somewhat casual attention. He did not look out of the
window again. The history of big Tom De Willoughby
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
alone was worth hearing. Farquhar did not find it necessary
to call Judge Rutherford&#8217;s attention to the fact that Sheba
and the mystery of Blair&#8217;s Hollow were not to be regarded
as evidence. He realised that they adorned the situation
and seemed to prove things whether it was strictly true that
they did so or not. The discovery of the coal, the fortunes
and disasters of Judge de Willoughby, the obstinate loyalty
abhorred and condemned of his neighbours, his loneliness
and poverty and death&mdash;his wasted estates, the big, bare,
empty house in which his sole known heir lived alone, were
material to hold any man&#8217;s attention, and, enlarged upon
by the member from Hamlin, were effective indeed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the Judge, wiping his forehead when he
had finished, &#8220;what do you think of that? Don&#8217;t you think
these people have a pretty strong claim?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That story sounds as if they had,&#8221; answered Farquhar;
&#8220;but the Government isn&#8217;t eager to settle claims&mdash;and you
never know what will be unearthed. If Judge De Willoughby
had not been such a blatantly open old opposer of his
neighbour&#8217;s political opinions these people wouldn&#8217;t have
a shadow of a chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jupiter!&#8221; exclaimed Rutherford, delightedly; &#8220;he
was persecuted&mdash;persecuted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a good thing for his relatives,&#8221; said Farquhar.
&#8220;Did you say the people had come to Washington?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All three of them,&#8221; answered the Judge, and this time
his tone was exultant; &#8220;Tom, and Sheba, and Rupert.
They&#8217;ve rented some little rooms out near Dupont Circle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to be taken to see them,&#8221; said Farquhar,
reflectively. &#8220;I should like to have a look at Big Tom De
Willoughby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221; cried the Judge. &#8220;Why, nothing would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
suit me better&mdash;or them either, for that matter. I&#8217;ll take
you any day you say&mdash;any day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t the easiest thing in the world to put a claim
through,&#8221; said Farquhar. &#8220;It means plenty of hard knocks
and hard work and anxiety. Do you know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about it,&#8221; answered the Judge.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m going to get this one through if there&#8217;s a way
of doing it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be misunderstood and called names and slandered,&#8221;
said Farquhar, regarding his rugged, ingenuous face
with some curiosity. &#8220;There may be people&mdash;even in Hamlin
County&mdash;who won&#8217;t believe you are not up to some big
deal. What are you doing it for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, for Tom and Sheba and Rupert,&#8221; said the Judge,
in an outburst of neighbourliness. &#8220;That&#8217;s folks enough
to do it for, ain&#8217;t it? There&#8217;s three of &#8217;em&mdash;and I&#8217;d do it
for ary one&mdash;as we say in Barnesville,&#8221; in discreet correction
of the colloquialism.
</p>
<p>Farquhar laughed a little, and put a hand on his shoulder
as they moved away together. &#8220;I believe you would,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;perhaps that sort of thing is commoner in Barnesville
than in Washington. I believe you would. Take me
to see the claimants to-morrow.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p>When Judge Rutherford piloted him up the broad, unpaved
avenue towards the small house near Dupont Circle,
the first objects which caught Farquhar&#8217;s gaze were two
young people standing among the unkempt rose and syringa
bushes in the little front garden. The slim grace and bloom
of their youth would have caught any eye. They were
laughing happily, and the girl held a branch of rosy blossoms
in her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they the claimants?&#8221; Farquhar enquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of them is,&#8221; answered Rutherford. &#8220;But Sheba&mdash;Sheba
counts somehow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheba looked at the stranger with the soft gaze of deer-like
eyes when he was presented to her. There was no shyness
in her woodland smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Judge Rutherford,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Uncle Matt has come&mdash;Rupert&#8217;s
Matt, you know. We can&#8217;t help laughing about
it, but we can&#8217;t help being happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boyish Southern face at her side laughed and glowed.
Matt represented to Rupert the Lares and Penates his emotional
nature required and had been denied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he were not such a practical creature,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
might not know what to do with him. But he worked his
way here by engaging himself for the journey as a sort of
nurse to an invalid young man who wanted to join his family
in Washington and was too weak to travel alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The further from romance the world drifts, the fairer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
it becomes in its fagged eyes. So few stories unfold themselves
sweetly from beginning to end that a first chapter
is always more or less alluring, and as he marked the youth
and beauty of those two and saw how their young eyes and
smiles met in question and response at every thought, to
Farquhar, who still retained the fragments of an imagination
not wholly blighted by the House of Representatives,
it seemed rather as if he had wandered into a world where
young Cupid and Psyche still moved and breathed in human
guise. As central figures of a government claim, the pair
were exquisitely incongruous. Their youth was so radiant
and untried, their bright good looks so bloomed, that the
man looking at them felt&mdash;with a realising sense of humour
as well as fanciful sentiment&mdash;as if a spring wind wafted
through a wood close grown with wild daffodils had swept
into a heated manufactory where machinery whirred and
ill-clad workers bent over their toil.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom will be very glad to see you,&#8221; said Sheba,
as they went into the house. &#8220;Judge Rutherford says you
will tell us what to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An interesting feature of the situation to Farquhar was
the entire frankness and simplicity of those concerned in it.
It was so clear that they knew nothing of the complications
they might be called upon to face, that their ignorance was
of the order of charm. If he had been some sharper claimant
come to fleece them, their visitor knew this young
dryad&#8217;s eyes would have smiled at him just as gratefully.
</p>
<p>As they mounted the stairs, a huge laugh broke forth
above, and when they entered the small sitting-room Uncle
Matt stood before Big Tom, holding forth gravely, his gray
wool bared, his decently shabby hat in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d er come as lady&#8217;s maid, Marse Thomas De Willoughby,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
he was saying, &#8220;ef I couldn&#8217;t er got here no other
way. Seemed like I jest got to honin&#8217; atter Marse Rupert,
an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t er stayed nohow. I gotter be whar dat boy
is&mdash;I jest <i>gotter</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Big Tom, rising to his full height to shake hands with
his visitor, appeared physically to cast such disparagement
on the size of the room as was almost embarrassing. Farquhar
saw all his values as he met his honest, humourous eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been talking to my nephew&#8217;s body-guard,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;All right, Uncle Matt. You just go to Miss Burford and
ask her to find you a shake-down. There&#8217;s always a place
to be found for a fellow like you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marse Thomas De Willoughby,&#8221; said Matt, &#8220;dish yer
niggah man&#8217;s not gwine to be in no one&#8217;s way. I come yere
to work&mdash;dat&#8217;s what I come yere for. An&#8217; work&#8217;s a thing
dat kin be hunted down&mdash;en a man ain&#8217;t needin&#8217; no gun
to hunt it neder&mdash;an&#8217; he needn&#8217;t be no mighty Nimrod.&#8221;
And he made his best bow to both men and shuffled out of
the room.
</p>
<p>To Farquhar his visit was an interesting experience and
a novel one. For months he had been feeling that he lived
in the whirl of a maelstrom of schemes and jobberies, the
inevitable result of the policy of a Government which had
promised to recoup those it had involuntarily wronged during
a national convulsion. Upon every side there had sprung
up claimants&mdash;many an honest one, and hordes of those not
honest. There were obvious thieves and specious ones, brilliant
tricksters and dull ones. Newspaper literature had been
incited by the number and variety of claims, and claims&mdash;to
a jocularity which spread over all the land. Farquhar
had seen most of the types&mdash;the greenhorn, the astute planner,
the man who had a wrong burning in his breast, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
man who knew how to approach his subject and the man
who did not, the man who buttonholed everybody and was
diffuse and hopeful, and the man who was helpless before
the task he had undertaken. He had never, however, seen
anything like the De Willoughby claimants&mdash;big Tom telling
his straightforward story with his unsanguine air, the
attractive youngster adding detail with simple directness,
and the girl, Sheba, her roe&#8217;s eyes dilated with eager interest
hanging upon their every word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is one of the best stories I&#8217;ve heard,&#8221; he said to Rutherford,
on their way back. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a big claim&mdash;it&#8217;s a
huge claim, and the Government is beginning to get restive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you think they&#8217;ll get it through?&#8221; exclaimed
Judge Rutherford. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t they <i>bound</i> to get it? It&#8217;s the
Lord&#8217;s truth&mdash;every word they speak&mdash;the Lord&#8217;s truth!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Farquhar, &#8220;that&#8217;s how it struck me;
but, as a rule, it isn&#8217;t the Lord&#8217;s truth that carries a big
claim through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke into a short laugh, as if at an inward realisation
of the aspect of the situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are as straightforward as a lot of children,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;They have nothing to hide, and they wouldn&#8217;t know
how to hide it if they had. It would be rather a joke if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
And he laughed again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If what?&#8221; asked Rutherford.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well! if that very fact was the thing which carried
them through,&#8221; his laugh ending in a shrewd smile.
</p>
<p>This carried the ingenuous mind of his companion beyond
its depth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see where the joke would come in,&#8221; he said,
rather ruefully. &#8220;I should have thought nothing else would
do it for them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>Farquhar slapped him on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you would,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why you are the best
advocate they could have. You are all woven out of the
same cloth. You stand by them&mdash;and so will I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Judge Rutherford seized his hand and shook it with affectionately
ardent pumpings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I wanted to make sure of,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to work at this thing, and I want a man to help me
who knows the ropes. Lord, how I should like to go back
to Hamlin and tell Jenny and the boys that I&#8217;d put Tom
through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And as they walked up the enclosed road to the Capitol
he devoted himself to describing anew Big Tom&#8217;s virtue,
popularity, and witticisms.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>For weeks Talbot&#8217;s Cross-roads found itself provided with
a conversational topic of absorbing interest. Ethan Cronan,
who had temporarily &#8220;taken on&#8221; the post-office and store,
had no cause to fear that the old headquarters was in danger
of losing popularity. The truth was that big Tom had
so long presided over the daily gatherings that the new
occupant of the premises was regarded merely as a sort of
friendly representative. Being an amiable and unambitious
soul, Ethan in fact regarded himself in the same light, and
felt supported and indeed elevated by the fact that he stood
in the shoes of a public character so universally popular
and admired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t Tom, an&#8217; I cayn&#8217;t never come a-nigh him,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;but I kin do my best not to cast no disgrace on his
place, an&#8217; allus tradin&#8217; as fair as I know how. It&#8217;s a kinder
honor to set in his chairs an&#8217; weigh sugar out in the scales
he used&mdash;an&#8217; it drors trade too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>During the passage of the first few weeks, horses, waggons,
and ox-teams crowded about the hitching-posts, while
excitement ran high at mail-time. The general opinion was
that any post might bring the news that Congress was &#8220;sitting
on&#8221; the great De Willoughby claim, and that Washington
waited breathless for its decision. That all other
national business should be suspended seemed inevitable.
That any mail should come and go without bringing some
news was not contemplated. The riders of the horses and
owners of the waggons sat upon the stone porch and discussed
probabilities. They told each other stories they had
gathered of the bygone glories of the De Willoughbys, of
the obstinate loyalty of the old Judge and the bitter indignation
of his neighbours, and enlarged upon the strength
of the claim this gave him to the consideration of the
Government.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom won&#8217;t have no trouble with his claim,&#8221; was the
general opinion. &#8220;He&#8217;ll just waltz it through. Thar won&#8217;t
be a hitch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But after the first letter in which he announced his safe
arrival in the Capital City, Tom wrote no more for a week
or so, which caused a disappointment only ameliorated by
the belief that he was engaged in &#8220;waltzing&#8221; the claim
through. Each man felt it necessary to visit the Cross-roads
every day to talk over the possible methods employed, and
to make valuable suggestions. Interest never flagged, but
it was greatly added to when it was known that Judge Rutherford
had ranged himself on Tom&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the pop-larest man in Hamlin County,&#8221; it was said,
&#8220;an&#8217; he&#8217;s bound to be a pop&#8217;lar man in Congress, an&#8217; have
a pull.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But when the summer had passed, and a touch of frost in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
the night air loosened the chestnuts in their burrs, and a
stray morning breeze shook them in showers down upon the
carpet of rustling yellowed leaves, Tom&#8217;s letters had become
few and far between, and none of them had contained any
account of the intentions of the legislative body with regard
to the claim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to tell, boys,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;As far as
I&#8217;ve gone, it seems a man gets a claim through Congress
by waiting about Washington and telling his story to different
people until he wears them out&mdash;or they wear him
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For some time after this they did not hear from him at
all. The winter set in, and the habitués of the Cross-roads
Post-office gathered about the glowing stove. Under the
influence of cold gray skies, biting air, leafless trees, and
bare land, the claim seemed somehow to have receded into
the distance. The sanguine confidence of the community
had not subsided into doubt so much as into helpless mystification.
Months had passed and nothing whatsoever had
happened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems somehow,&#8221; said Jabe Doty one night, as he tilted
his chair forward and stared at the fire in the stove, &#8220;seems
somehow as if Tom was a right smart ways off&mdash;es ef he got
furder as the winter closed in&mdash;a&#8217;most like Washin&#8217;ton city
hed moved a thousand miles or so out West somewhars, an&#8217;
took him with it.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p>To Tom himself it seemed that it was the old, easy-going
mountain life which had receded. The days when he had sat
upon the stone porch and watched the sun rise from behind
one mountain and set behind another seemed to belong to
a life lived centuries ago. But that he knew little of occult
beliefs and mysteries, he would have said to himself that
all these things must have happened in a long past incarnation.
</p>
<p>The matter of the De Willoughby claim was brought before
the House. Judge Rutherford opened the subject one
day with a good deal of nervous excitement. He had supplied
himself with many notes, and found some little difficulty
in managing them, being new to the work, and he
grew hot and uncertain because he could not secure an
audience. Claims had already become old and tiresome
stories, and members who were unoccupied pursued their
conversation unmovedly, giving the speaker only an occasional
detached glance. The two representatives of their
country sitting nearest to him were, not at all furtively, eating
apples and casting their cores and parings into their
particular waste-paper baskets. This was discouraging and
baffling. To quote the Judge himself, no one knew anything
about Hamlin County, and certainly no one was disturbed
by any desire to be told about it.
</p>
<p>That night Rutherford went to the house near Dupont
Circle. Big Tom was sitting in the porch with Rupert
and Sheba. Uncle Matt was digging about the roots of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
rose-bush, and the Judge caught a glimpse of Miss Burford
looking out from behind the parlour curtains.
</p>
<p>The Judge wore a wearied and vaguely bewildered look
as he sat down and wiped his forehead with a large, clean
white handkerchief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all different from what I thought&mdash;it&#8217;s all different,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Things often are,&#8221; remarked Tom, &#8220;oftener than not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert and Sheba glanced at each other questioningly and
listened with anxious eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s different in a different way from what I expected,&#8221;
the Judge went on. &#8220;They might have said and
done a dozen things I should have been sort of ready for,
but they didn&#8217;t. Somehow it seemed as if&mdash;as if the whole
thing didn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom got up and began to walk about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the way things begin that are going to rush
through,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Sheba followed him and slipped her hand through his
arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;that perhaps we shall
not get the money at all, Uncle Tom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom folded her hand in his&mdash;which was easily done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that if we do get it,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;it will
not come to us before we want it pretty badly&mdash;the Lord
knows how badly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For every day counts in the expenditure of a limited sum,
and on days of discouragement Tom&#8217;s calculation of their
resources left him a troubled man.
</p>
<p>When Judge Rutherford had gone Rupert sat with Sheba
in the scented summer darkness. He drew his chair opposite
to hers and took one of her hands in both of his own.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I have done a wrong thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Suppose
I have dragged you and Uncle Tom into trouble?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you came,&#8221; in a quick, soft voice. &#8220;I am
glad you came.&#8221; And the slight, warm fingers closed round
his.
</p>
<p>He lifted them to his lips and kissed them over and over
again. &#8220;Are you glad I came?&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Oh,
Sheba! Sheba!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say &#8216;Oh, Sheba&#8217;?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I love you so&mdash;and I am so young&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
know what to do. You know I love you, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She leaned forward so that he saw her lovely gazelle eyes
lifted and most innocently tender. &#8220;I want you to love me,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;I could not bear you not to love me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He hesitated a second, and then suddenly pressed his
glowing face upon her palm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t love you as Uncle Tom loves you, Sheba,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I love you&mdash;young as I am&mdash;I love you&mdash;differently.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her swaying nearer to him was a sweetly unconscious and
involuntary thing. Their young eyes drowned themselves
in each other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you,&#8221; she said, the note of a young ring-dove
answering her mate murmuring in her voice, &#8220;I want you
to love me&mdash;as you love me. I love your way of loving
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Darling!&#8221; broke from him, his boy&#8217;s heart beating fast
and high. And their soft young lips were, through some
mystery of power, drawn so near to each other that they
met like flowers moved to touching by the summer wind.
</p>
<p>Later Rupert went to Tom, who sat by an open window
in his room and looked out on the moonlit stretch of avenue.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
The boy&#8217;s heart was still beating fast, and, as the white light
struck his face, it showed his eyes more like Delia Vanuxem&#8217;s
than they had ever been. Their darkness held just the look
Tom remembered, but could never have described or explained
to himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom,&#8221; he began, in an unsteady voice, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
go to bed without telling you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom glanced up at him and learned a great deal. He
put a big hand on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, boy,&#8221; he said, his kind eyes warming. Rupert
sat down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I ought not to have done it,&#8221; he broke forth.
&#8220;I did not know I was going to do it. I suppose I am too
young. I did not mean to&mdash;but I could not help it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheba?&#8221; Tom inquired, simply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her eyes were so lovely,&#8221; poured forth the boy. &#8220;She
looked at me so like an angel. Whenever she is near me, it
seems as if something were drawing us together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was Tom&#8217;s quiet answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to tell you all about it,&#8221; impetuously. &#8220;I have
been so lonely, Uncle Tom, since my mother died. You
don&#8217;t know how I loved her&mdash;how close we were to each
other. She was so sweet and wonderful&mdash;and I had nothing
else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom nodded gently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I never forgot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He put the big hand on the boy&#8217;s knee this time. &#8220;I
loved her too,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and <i>I</i> had nothing else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know&mdash;you know!&#8221; cried Rupert. &#8220;You remember
what it was to sit quite near her and see her look
at you in that innocent way&mdash;how you longed to cry out
and take her in your arms.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>Tom stirred in his seat. Time rolled back twenty-five
years.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my God, yes&mdash;I remember!&#8221; he answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like that to-night,&#8221; the young lover went on.
&#8220;And I could not stop myself. I told her I loved her&mdash;and
she said she wanted me to love her&mdash;and we kissed
each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Big Tom got up and stood before the open window. His
hands were thrust deep into his pockets and he stared out
at the beauty of the night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what <i>ought</i> to come to
every man that lives&mdash;but it doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert poured forth his confession, restrained no more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From that first night when I rode through the mountains
over the white road and stopped at your gate&mdash;since
I looked up and saw her standing on the balcony with the
narcissus in her hair it has always been the same thing. It
began that very moment&mdash;it was there when she leaned forward
and spoke to me. I had never thought of a woman
before&mdash;I was too poor and sad and lonely and young. And
there she was&mdash;all white&mdash;and it seemed as if she was
<i>mine</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom nodded his head as if to a white rose-bush in the
small garden.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am as poor as ever I was,&#8221; said Rupert. &#8220;I am a
beggar if we lose our claim; but I am not sad, and I am not
lonely&mdash;I can&#8217;t be&mdash;I can&#8217;t be! I am happy&mdash;everything&#8217;s
happy&mdash;because she knows&mdash;and I have kissed her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you think I would say when you told me?&#8221;
Tom asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; impetuously; &#8220;but I knew I must come
to you. It seems a million years ago since that hot morning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
in the old garden at Delisleville&mdash;when I had never seen
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things I have thought about a good deal,&#8221;
said Tom, with quite a practical manner, &#8220;has been love.
I had lots of time to think over things at the Cross-roads,
and I used to work them out as far as my mind would carry
me. Love&#8217;s as much an element as the rest of them. There&#8217;s
earth, air, fire, water&mdash;and love. It has to be calculated for.
What I&#8217;ve reasoned out is that it has not been calculated
for enough. It&#8217;s going to <i>come</i> to all of us&mdash;and it will
either come and stay, and make the old earth bloom with
flowers&mdash;or it will come and go, and leave it like a plain
swept by fire. It&#8217;s not a trivial thing that only boys and
girls play with; it&#8217;s better&mdash;and worse. It ought to be prepared
for and treated well. It&#8217;s not often treated well.
People have got into the way of expecting trouble and tragedy
to come out of it. We are always hearing of its unhappiness
in books. Poets write about it that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is often unhappy,&#8221; said Rupert; &#8220;but just
now it seems as if it <i>could</i> not be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>I&#8217;ve</i> been wanting to see,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;is young
love come up like a flower and be given its dew and sun
and rain&mdash;and bloom and bloom its best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew a big sigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That poor child who lies on the hillside under the pines,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;Sheba&#8217;s mother&mdash;hers was young love&mdash;and
it brought tragedy and death. Delia,&#8221; his voice was unsteady,
&#8220;your mother&#8217;s was young love, and her heart was
broken. No, it&#8217;s not often well treated. And when you
and Sheba came to me that night with your boy and girl
eyes shining with gladness just because you had met each
other, I said to myself, &#8216;By the Lord, here is what it springs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
from. Perhaps it may come to them; I wonder if it
will?&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You thought it might, even then,&#8221; Rupert cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; was Tom&#8217;s answer. &#8220;You were young&mdash;you
were drawn together&mdash;it seemed natural. I used to
watch you, and think it over, making a kind of picture to
myself of how it would be if two young things could meet
each other and join hands and wander on among roses until
they reached the gate of life&mdash;and it swung open for them
and they passed through and found another paradise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped a second and turned to look at Rupert&#8217;s
dreamy face with a smile not all humorous. &#8220;I&#8217;m a sentimental
chap for my size,&#8221; he added. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I
wanted for Sheba and you&mdash;that&#8217;s what I want. That sort
of thing was left out of my life; but I should like to see
it before I&#8217;m done with. Good God! why can&#8217;t people be
<i>happy</i>? I want people to be <i>happy</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy was trembling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Sheba and I are happy to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then God have mercy on the soul of the man who would
spoil it for you,&#8221; said Big Tom, with actual solemnity.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not that man. You two just go on being happy; try
and make up for what your two mothers had to bear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert got up from his chair and caught the big hand
in his. It was a boy&#8217;s action, and he looked particularly
like a boy as he did it. &#8220;It is just like you,&#8221; he broke
forth. &#8220;I did not know what you would say when I told
you&mdash;but I ought to have known you would say something
like this. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s as big as you are, Uncle Tom,&#8221; ingenuously.
</p>
<p>That was his good-night. When he went away Big Tom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
settled into his chair again and looked out for some time
longer at the bright night. He was going back to two other
nights which lay in the years behind. One was the night
he turned his back on Delisleville and rode towards the
mountain with a weight on his kindly heart which he had
grimly told himself seemed to weigh a ton; the other was
the night he had been wakened from his sleep by the knock
on the door of the bedroom behind the Cross-roads Post-office
and had ridden out under the whiteness of the moon
to find in the bare cabin at Blair&#8217;s Hollow the little fair
girl who had sobbed and died as she clung to his warm hand.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>

<p>The world had heard and talked much of the Reverend
John Baird in the years which followed his return to Willowfield.
During the first few months after his reappearance
among them, his flock had passed through a phase of restless
uncertainty with regard to him. Certain elder members
of his congregation had privately discussed questions
of doctrine with anxiousness. Had not Nature already arraigned
herself upon the man&#8217;s side by bestowing upon him
a powerful individuality, heads might have been shaken,
and the matter discussed openly instead of in considerately
confidential conclave. It was, however, less easy to enter
into argument with such a man than with one slow and
uncertain of tongue, and one whose fortunes rested in the
hands of the questioners. Besides, it was not to be denied
that even the elderly and argumentative found themselves
listening to his discourses. The young and emotional often
thrilled and quaked before them. In his hour he was the
pioneer of what to-day we call the modern, and seemed to
speak his message not to a heterogeneous mental mass, but
to each individual man and woman who sat before him with
upturned face. He was daringly human for the time in
which he lived, it being the hour when humanity was overpowered
by deity, and to be human was to be iconoclastic.
His was not the doctrine of the future&mdash;of future repentance
for the wrongs done to-day, of future reward for the good
to-day achieves, all deeds being balanced on a mercantile
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
account of profit and loss. His was a cry almost fierce,
demanding, in the name of human woe, that to-day shall
hold no cruelty, no evil done, even to the smallest and most
unregarded thing.
</p>
<p>By some chance&mdash;though he alone realised the truth of
the fact&mdash;the subjects of his most realistic and intense appeals
to his hearers had the habit of developing themselves
in his close talks with Latimer. Among the friends of the
man on whom all things seemed to smile, the man on whom
the sun had never shone, and who faithfully worshipped him,
was known as his Shadow. It was not an unfitting figure
of speech. Dark, gloomy, and inarticulate, he was a strange
contrast to the man he loved; but, from the hour he had
stood by Latimer&#8217;s side, leaning against the rail of the returning
steamer, listening to the monotonously related story
of the man&#8217;s bereavement, John Baird had felt that Fate
herself had knit their lives together. He had walked the
deck alone long hours that night, and when the light of the
moon had broken fitfully through the stormily drifting
clouds, it had struck upon a pallid face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor fellow!&#8221; he had said between his teeth; &#8220;poor
darkling, tragic fellow! I must try&mdash;try&mdash;oh, my God! I
must try&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then their lives had joined currents at Willowfield, and
the friendship Baird had asked for had built itself on a
foundation of stone.
</p>
<p>There was nothing requiring explanation in the fact that
to the less fortunate man Baird&#8217;s every gift of wit and ease
was a pleasure and comfort. His mere physical attractions
were a sort of joy. When Latimer caught sight of his own
lank, ill-carried figure and his harshly rugged sallow face,
he never failed to shrink from them and avert his eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
To be the companion of a man whose every movement suggested
strength and grace, whose skin was clear and healthful,
his features well balanced and admirable in line&mdash;to
be the friend of a human being built by nature as all human
beings should be built if justice were done to them, was
nourishment to his own starved needs.
</p>
<p>When he assumed his charge at the squalid little town
of Janway&#8217;s Mills, his flock looked askance at him. He
was not harsh of soul, but he was gloomy and had not the
power to convey encouragement or comfort, though he laboured
with strenuous conscientiousness. Among the sordid
commonness of the every-day life of the mill hands and
their families he lived and moved as Savonarola had moved
and lived in the midst of the picturesque wickedness and
splendidly coloured fanaticism of Italy in dim, rich centuries
past; but his was the asceticism and stern self-denial
of Savonarola without the uplifting power of passionate
eloquence and fire which, through their tempest, awakened
and shook human souls. He had no gifts of compelling
fervor; he could not arouse or warm his hearers; he never
touched them. He preached to them, he visited them at
their homes, he prayed beside their dying and their dead,
he gave such aid in their necessities as the narrowness of
his means would allow, but none of them loved him or
did more than stoically accept him and his services.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at us as we stand together,&#8221; he said to Baird on
an evening when they stood side by side within range of
an old-fashioned mirror. &#8220;Those things your reflection
represents show me the things I was born without. I might
make my life a daily crucifixion of self-denial and duty done
at all costs, but I could not wear your smile or speak with
your voice. I am a man, too,&#8221; with smothered passion; &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
am a man, too! And yet&mdash;what woman looks smilingly at
<i>me</i>&mdash;what child draws near unafraid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are of the severe monastic temperament,&#8221; answered
Baird. &#8220;It is all a matter of temperament. Mine
is facile and a slave to its emotions. Saints and martyrs are
made of men like you&mdash;never of men such as I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure of the value to the world of saints and
martyrs?&#8221; said Latimer. &#8220;I am not. That is the worst
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! the world,&#8221; Baird reflected. &#8220;If we dare to come
back to the world&mdash;to count it as a factor&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only the world we know,&#8221; Latimer said, his harsh
voice unsteady; &#8220;the world&#8217;s sorrow&mdash;the world&#8217;s pain&mdash;the
world&#8217;s power to hurt and degrade itself. That is what seems
to concern us&mdash;if we dare to say so&mdash;we, who were thrust
into it against our wills, and forced to suffer and see others
suffer. The man who was burned at the stake, or torn in
the arena by wild beasts, believed he won a crown for himself&mdash;but
it was for <i>himself</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What doth it profit a man,&#8221; quoted Baird, vaguely, but
as if following a thought of his own, &#8220;if he gain the whole
world and lose his own soul?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer flung back his shock of uneven black locks. His
hollow eyes flashed daringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What doth it profit a man,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;if he save his
own soul and lose the whole world, caring nothing for its
agony, making no struggle to help it in its woe and grieving?
A Man once gave His life for the world. Has any man
ever given his soul?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You go far&mdash;you go far!&#8221; exclaimed Baird, drawing a
short, sharp breath.
</p>
<p>Latimer&#8217;s deep eyes dwelt upon him woefully. &#8220;Have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
you known what it was to bear a heavy sin on your soul?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; said John Baird, a little bitterly, &#8220;it
is such men as I, whose temperaments&mdash;the combination
of forces you say you lack&mdash;lead them to the deeds the world
calls &#8216;heavy sins&#8217;&mdash;and into the torment of regret which
follows. You can bear no such burden&mdash;you have no such
regret.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer, whose elbow rested on the mantel, leaned a
haggard forehead on his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have sinned,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was that others might
be spared; but I have put my soul in peril. Perhaps it is
lost&mdash;lost!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird laid a hand on his shoulder and shook him. It was
a singular movement with passion in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Rouse, man, and let your reason
speak. In peril? Lost&mdash;for some poor rigid law broken
to spare others? Great God! No!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Reason!&#8221; said Latimer. &#8220;What you and I must preach
each week of our lives is that it is not reason a man must
be ruled by, but blind, wilful faith.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not preach it,&#8221; Baird interposed. &#8220;There are
things I dare to leave unsaid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have spoken falsely,&#8221; Latimer went on, heavily. &#8220;I
have lived a lie&mdash;a lie&mdash;but it was to save pure hearts from
breaking. They would have broken beneath the weight
of what I have borne for them. If I must bear punishment
for that, I&mdash;Let me bear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rigid submission of generations of the Calvinistic
conscience which presumed to ask no justice from its God
and gave praise as for mercy shown for all things which
were not damnation, and which against damnation&#8217;s self
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
dared not lift its voice in rebellion, had so far influenced
the very building of his being that the revolt of reason in
his brain filled him with gloomy terror. There was the
appeal of despair on his face as he looked at Baird.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your life, your temperament have given you a wider
horizon than mine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have never been in touch
with human beings. I have only read religious books&mdash;stern,
pitiless things. Since my boyhood I have lived in
terror of the just God&mdash;the just God&mdash;who visits the sins
of the fathers upon the children even to the third and fourth
generation. I&mdash;Baird&mdash;&#8221; his voice dropping, his face pallid,
&#8220;I have <i>hated</i> Him. I keep His laws, it is my fate to preach
His word&mdash;and I cower before Him as a slave before a
tyrant, with hatred in my heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; Baird broke forth, involuntarily. The
force of the man&#8217;s desperate feeling, his horror of himself,
his tragic truthfulness, were strange things to stand face
to face with. He had never confronted such a thing before,
and it shook him.
</p>
<p>Latimer&#8217;s face relaxed into a singular, rather pathetic
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; he repeated; &#8220;we all say that&mdash;I say it
myself. It seems the natural human cry. I wonder what
it means? It surely means something&mdash;something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Baird looked at him desperately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a more exalted creature than I could ever be,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I am a poor thing by comparison; but life struck
the wrong note for you. It was too harsh. You have lived
among the hideous cruelties of old doctrines until they have
wrought evil in your brain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stood up and threw out his arms with an involuntary
gesture, as if he were flinging off chains.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, they are not true! They are not true!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;They belong to the dark ages. They are relics
of the days when the upholders of one religion believed that
they saved souls by the stake and the rack and thumbscrew.
There were men and women who did believe it with rigid
honesty. There were men and women who, believing
in other forms, died in torture for their belief. There <i>is</i>
no God Who would ask such demoniac sacrifice. We have
come to clearer days. Somewhere&mdash;somewhere there is
light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were born with the temperament to see its far-off
glimmer even in your darkest hour,&#8221; Latimer said. &#8220;It is
for such as you to point it out to such as I am. Show it to
me&mdash;show it to me every moment if you can!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird put his hand on the man&#8217;s shoulder again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The world is surging away from it&mdash;the chained mind,
the cruelty, the groping in the dark,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as it surged
away from the revengeful Israelitish creed of &#8216;eye for eye
and tooth for tooth&#8217; when Christ came. It has taken centuries
to reach, even thus far; but, as each century passed,
each human creature who yearned over and suffered with
his fellow has been creeping on dragging, bleeding knees
towards the light. But the century will never come which
will surge away from the Man who died in man&#8217;s agony
for men. In thought of Him one may use reason and needs
no faith.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The germ of one of the most moving and frequently
quoted of Baird&#8217;s much-discussed discourses sprang&mdash;he told
his friends afterwards&mdash;from one such conversation, and was
the outcome of speech of the dead girl Margery. On a black
and wet December day he came into his study, on his return
from some parish visits, to find Latimer sitting before the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
fire, staring miserably at something he held in his hand.
It was a little daguerrotype of Margery at fifteen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found it in an old desk of mine,&#8221; he said, holding it
out to Baird, who took it and slightly turned away to lean
against the mantel, as he examined it.
</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s large eyes seemed to light up the ugly shadows
of the old-fashioned mushroom hat she wore, the soft bow
of her mouth was like a little Love&#8217;s, she bloomed with an
angelic innocence, and in her straight sweet look was the
unconscious question of a child-woman creature at the dawn
of life.
</p>
<p>John Baird stood looking down at the heavenly, tender
little face.
</p>
<p>There was a rather long silence. During its passing he
was far away. He was still far away when at length an
exclamation left his lips. He did not hear his words himself&mdash;he
did not remember Latimer, or notice his quick
movement of surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How sweet she was!&#8221; he broke forth. &#8220;How sweet
she was! How sweet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He put his hand up and touched his forehead with the
action of a man in a dream.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; he said, low and passionately, &#8220;sometimes
I am sick with longing for her&mdash;<i>sick</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; Latimer exclaimed. &#8220;<i>You</i> are heart-sick for
her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird came back. The startled sound in the voice awoke
him. He felt himself, as it were, dragged back from another
world, breathless, as by a giant&#8217;s hand. He looked up, dazed,
the hand holding the daguerrotype dropping helplessly by
his side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not so strange that it should come to that,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
&#8220;I seem to know her so well. I think,&#8221; there was a look
of sharp pain on his face&mdash;&#8220;I think I know the pitiful
childlike suffering her dying eyes held.&#8221; And the man
actually shuddered a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&mdash;I know it!&#8221; Latimer cried, and he let his
forehead drop upon his hands and sat staring at the carpet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard and thought of her until she has become
a living creature,&#8221; John Baird said. &#8220;I hear of her from
others than yourself. Miss Starkweather&mdash;that poor girl
from the mills, Susan Chapman&mdash;you yourself&mdash;keep her
before me, alive. I seem to know the very deeps of her
lovingness&mdash;and understand her. Oh, that she should have
<i>died</i>!&#8221; He turned his face away and spoke his next words
slowly and in a lowered voice. &#8220;If I had found her when
I came back free&mdash;if I had found her here, living&mdash;we two
might have been brothers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; Latimer cried, rising. &#8220;You&mdash;it could
not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew his hand across his forehead and eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we saying?&#8221; he exclaimed, stammeringly.
&#8220;What are we thinking of? For a moment it seemed as if
she were alive again. Poor little Margery, with her eyes
like blue flowers, she has been dead years and years and
years.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was not long after this that the Reverend John Baird
startled a Boston audience one night by his lecture, &#8220;Repentance.&#8221;
In it he unfolded a new passionate creed which
produced the effect of an electric shock. Newspapers reported
it, editorials discussed it, articles were written upon
it in monthly magazines. &#8220;Repentance is too late,&#8221; was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
the note his deepest fervour struck with virile, almost terrible,
intensity. &#8220;Repent before your wrong is done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Repentance comes too late,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;We say a man
saves his soul by it&mdash;<i>his</i> soul! We are a base, cowardly lot.
Our own souls are saved&mdash;yes! And we hug ourselves and
are comforted. But what of the thing we have hurt&mdash;for
no man ever lost his soul unless he lost it by the wound
he gave another&mdash;by inflicting in some other an agony?
What of the one who has suffered&mdash;who has wept blood?
I repent and save <i>myself</i>; but repentance cannot undo.
The torture has been endured&mdash;the tears of blood shed. It
is not to God I must kneel and pray for pardon, but to that
one whose helplessness I slew, and, though he grant it me,
he still has been slain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The people who sat before him stirred in their seats; some
leaned forward, breathing quickly. There were those who
turned pale; here and there a man bent his head and a
woman choked back a sob, or sat motionless with streaming
eyes. &#8220;Repentance is too late&mdash;except for him who buys
hope and peace with it. A lifetime of it cannot <i>undo</i>.&#8221; The
old comfortable convention seemed to cease to be supporting.
It seemed to cease to be true that one may wound and
crush and kill, and then be admirable in escaping by smug
repentance. It seemed to cease to be true that humanity
need count only with an abstract, far-off Deity Who can
easily afford to pardon&mdash;that one of his poor myriads has
been done to death. It was all new&mdash;strange&mdash;direct&mdash;and
each word fell like a blow from a hammer, because a strong,
dramatic, reasoning creature spoke from the depths of his
own life and soul. In him Humanity rose up an awful reality,
which must itself be counted with&mdash;not because it
could punish and revenge, but because the laws of nature
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
cried aloud as a murdered man&#8217;s blood cries from the
ground.
</p>
<p>As Baird crossed the pavement to reach his cab, the first
night he delivered this lecture, a man he knew but slightly
stepped to his side and spoke to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Baird,&#8221; he said, &#8220;will you drive me to the station?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird turned and looked at him in some surprise. There
were cabs enough within hailing distance. The man was
well known as a journalist, rather celebrated for his good
looks and masculine charm. He was of the square-shouldered,
easy-moving, rich-coloured type; just now his handsome
eye looked perturbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going away suddenly,&#8221; he said, in answer to Baird&#8217;s
questioning expression. &#8220;I want to catch the next train.
I want you to see me off&mdash;<i>you</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us get in,&#8221; was Baird&#8217;s brief reply. He had an
instant revelation that the circumstance was not trivial or
accidental.
</p>
<p>As the door closed and the cab rolled away his companion
leaned back, folding his arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had an hour to pass before keeping an appointment,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;And I dropped in to hear you. You put things
before a man in a new way. You are appallingly vivid. I
am not going to keep my appointment. It is not easy <i>not</i>
to keep it! I shall take the train to New York and catch
to-morrow&#8217;s steamer to Liverpool. Don&#8217;t leave me until
you have seen me off. I want to put the Atlantic Ocean
and a year of time between myself and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Temptation,&#8221; said Baird, though he scarcely realised
that he spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the devil!&#8221; exclaimed the other man savagely.
&#8220;Call her that if you like&mdash;call me that&mdash;call the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
thing that! She does not realise where we are drifting.
She&#8217;s a lovely dreamer and has not realised that we are
human. I did not allow myself to realise it until the passion
of your words brought me face to face with myself. I am
repenting in time. Don&#8217;t leave me! I can&#8217;t carry it through
to-night alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Baird leaned back in the corner of the carriage and
folded his arms also. His heart was leaping beneath them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great God!&#8221; he said, out of the darkness. &#8220;I wish
someone had said such words to me&mdash;years ago&mdash;and not
left me afterwards! Years ago!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; his companion answered, briefly. &#8220;You
could not have painted it with such flaming power&mdash;otherwise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They did not speak again during the drive. They scarcely
exchanged a dozen words before they parted. The train
was in the station when they entered it.
</p>
<p>Five minutes later John Baird stood upon the platform,
looking after the carriages as they rolled out noisily behind
trailing puffs of smoke and steam.
</p>
<p>He had asked no questions, and, so far as his own knowledge
was concerned, this was the beginning, the middle, and
the end of the story. But he knew that there had been
a story, and there might have been a tragedy. It seemed
that the intensity of his own cry for justice and mercy had
arrested at least one of the actors in it before the curtain
fell.
</p>
<p>A few nights later, as they sat together, Baird and Latimer
spoke of this incident and of the lecture it had followed
upon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Repentance! Repentance!&#8221; Latimer said. &#8220;What led
<i>you</i> to dwell upon repentance?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty years of life,&#8221; was Baird&#8217;s answer. &#8220;Forty of
them.&#8221; He was leaning forward gazing into the red-hot
coals. &#8220;And after our talk,&#8221; he added, deliberately.
&#8220;Margery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer turned and gazed at him.
</p>
<p>Baird nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Her picture. Her innocent face and
the soft, helpless youth of it. Such young ignorance is
helpless&mdash;helpless! If in any hour of ruthlessness&mdash;or madness&mdash;a
man had done such tenderness a wrong, what repentance&mdash;<i>what</i>
repentance could undo?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; said Latimer, and the words were a groan.
&#8220;None&mdash;through all eternity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not a long silence which followed, but it seemed
long to both of them. A dead stillness fell upon the room.
Baird felt as if he were waiting for something. He knew
he was waiting for something, though he could not have
explained to himself the sensation. Latimer seemed waiting
too&mdash;awaiting the power and steadiness to reach some resolve.
But at length he reached it. He sat upright and
clutched the arms of his chair. It was for support.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not now?&#8221; he cried; &#8220;why not now? I trust
you! I trust you! Let me unburden my soul. I will try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Baird&#8217;s involuntary habit to sink into easy attitudes;
the long, supple form of his limbs and body lent
themselves to grace and ease. But he sat upright also, his
hands unconsciously taking hold upon the arms of his chair
as his companion did.
</p>
<p>For a moment the two gazed into each other&#8217;s eyes, and
the contrast between their types was a strange one&mdash;the
one man&#8217;s face dark, sallow, harsh, the other fine, sensitive,
and suddenly awake with emotion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I trust you,&#8221; said Latimer again. &#8220;I would not have
confessed the truth to any other living creature&mdash;upon the
rack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His forehead looked damp under his black locks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not have confessed the <i>truth</i>,&#8221; Baird asked,
in a hushed voice, &#8220;about what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery,&#8221; answered Latimer. &#8220;Margery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw Baird make a slight forward movement, and he
went on monotonously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not die in Italy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She did not die
lying smiling in the evening sun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&mdash;did not?&#8221; Baird&#8217;s low cry was a thing of horror.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She died,&#8221; Latimer continued, in dull confession, &#8220;in
a log cabin in the mountains of North Carolina. She died
in anguish&mdash;the mother of an hour-old child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God! My God! My God!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Three times the cry broke from Baird.
</p>
<p>He got up and walked across the room and back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait&mdash;wait a moment!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;For a moment
don&#8217;t go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the years had passed, more than once he had been
haunted by a dread that some day he might come upon some
tragic truth long hidden. Here he was face to face with it.
But what imagination could have painted it like this?
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think my lie&mdash;a damnable thing,&#8221; said Latimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; answered the other man, harshly. &#8220;No, no!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He moved to and fro, and Latimer went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never understood,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She was a pure creature,
and a loving, innocent one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Baird groaned; &#8220;loving and innocent. Go on&mdash;go
on! It breaks my heart&mdash;it breaks my heart!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Remembering that he had said &#8220;You might have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
my brother,&#8221; Latimer caught his breath in a groan too. He
understood. He had forgotten&mdash;forgotten. But now he
must go on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At home she had been always a bright, happy, tender
thing. She loved us and we loved her. She was full of
delicate gifts. We are poor people; we denied ourselves
that we might send her to Boston to develop her talent.
She went away, radiant and full of innocent gratitude. For
some time she was very happy. I was making every effort
to save money to take her abroad that she might work in
the studios there. She had always been a delicate little
creature&mdash;and when it seemed that her health began to fail,
we feared the old terrible New England scourge of consumption.
It always took such bright things as she was. When
she came home for a visit her brightness seemed gone. She
drooped and could not eat or sleep. We could not bear to
realise it. I thought that if I could take her to France or
Italy she might be saved. I thought of her day and night&mdash;day
and night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused, and the great knot in his throat worked convulsively
in the bondage of his shabby collar. He began
again when he recovered his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought too much,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it
was. But just at that time there was a miserable story
going on at the mills&mdash;I used to see the poor girl day by
day&mdash;and hear the women talk. You know how that class
of woman talks and gives you details and enlarges on them?
The girl was about Margery&#8217;s age. I don&#8217;t know how it was;
but one day, as I was standing listening to a gossipping
married woman in one of their squalid, respectable parlours,
and she was declaiming and denouncing and pouring forth
anecdotes, suddenly&mdash;quite suddenly&mdash;I felt as if something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
had struck me. I turned sick and white and had to sit down.
Oh, God! what an afternoon that was! and how long it
seemed before I got back home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped again. This time he wiped sweat from his
forehead before he continued, hoarsely:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot go over it&mdash;I cannot describe the steps by which
I was led to&mdash;horrid fear. For two weeks I did not sleep
a single night. I thought I was going mad. I laid awake
making desperate plans&mdash;to resort to in case&mdash;in case&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>His forehead was wet again, and he stopped to touch it
with his handkerchief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One day I told my mother I was going to Boston to see
Margery&mdash;to talk over the possibility of our going abroad
together with the money I had worked for and saved. I had
done newspaper work&mdash;I had written religious essays&mdash;I had
taught. I went to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Baird who broke the thread of his speech now.
He had been standing before a window, his back to the
room. He turned about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You found?&#8221; he exclaimed, low and unsteady. &#8220;You
found&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was true,&#8221; answered Latimer. &#8220;The worst.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird stood stock still; if Latimer had been awake to
externals he would have seen that it was because he could
not move&mdash;or speak. He was like a man stunned.
</p>
<p>Latimer continued:
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was sitting in her little room alone when I entered
it. She looked as if she had been passing through hours
of convulsive sobbing. She sat with her poor little hands
clutching each other on her knees. Hysteric shudders were
shaking her every few seconds, and her eyes were blinded
with weeping. A child who had been beaten brutally might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
have sat so. She was too simple and weak to bear the awful
terror and woe. She was not strong enough to conceal what
there was to hide. She did not even get up to greet me,
but sat trembling like an aspen leaf.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say to her?&#8221; Baird cried out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only remember as one remembers a nightmare,&#8221; the
other man answered, passing his hand over his brow. &#8220;It
was a black nightmare. I saw before I spoke, and I began
to shake as she was shaking. I sat down before her and
took both her hands. I seemed to hear myself saying, &#8216;Margery&mdash;Margery,
don&#8217;t be frightened&mdash;don&#8217;t be afraid of Lucian.
I will help you, Margery; I have come to talk to you&mdash;just
to talk to you.&#8217; That was all. And she fell upon
the floor and lay with her face on my feet, her hands clutching
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For almost five minutes there was no other word spoken,
but the breathing of each man could be heard.
</p>
<p>Then Latimer&#8217;s voice broke the stillness, lower and more
monotonous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had but one resolve. It was to save her and to save
my mother. All the soul of our home and love was bound
up in the child. Among the desperate plans I had made in
the long nights of lying awake there had been one stranger
than the rest. I had heard constantly of Americans encountering
each other by chance when they went abroad.
When one has a secret to keep one is afraid of every chance,
however remote. Perhaps my plan was mad, but it accomplished
what I wanted. Years before I had travelled through
the mountain districts of North Carolina. One day, in riding
through the country roads, I had realised their strange
remoteness from the world, and the fancy had crossed my
mind that a criminal who dressed and lived as the rudely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
scattered population did, and who chose a lonely spot in
the woods, might be safer there than with the ocean rolling
between him and his secret. I spent hours in telling her
the part she was to play. It was to be supposed that we
had gone upon the journey originally planned. We were
to be hidden&mdash;apparently man and wife&mdash;in some log cabin
off the road until all was over. I studied the details as a
detective studies his case. I am not a brilliant man, and
it was intricate work; but I was desperate. I read guide-books
and wrote letters from different points, and arranged
that they should be sent to our mother at certain dates for
the next few months.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My stronghold was that she was quite ignorant of travel
and would think of nothing but that the letters came from
me and were about Margery. I made Margery write two or
three. Then I knew I could explain that she was not strong
enough to write herself. I was afraid she might break down
before we could leave home; but she did not. I got her
away. By roundabout ways we travelled to the North Carolina
mountains. We found a deserted cabin in the woods,
some distance from the road. We dressed ourselves in the
rough homespun of the country. She went barefooted, as
most of the women did. We so secluded ourselves that it
was some time before it was known that our cabin was inhabited.
The women have a habit of wearing deep sunbonnets
when about their work. Margery always wore one
and kept within doors. We were thought to be only an unsociable
married pair. Only once she found herself facing
curious eyes. A sharp-faced little hoosier stopped one day
to ask for a drink of water when I was away. He stared
at her so intently that she was frightened; but he never
came again. The child was born. She died.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When it was born,&#8221; Baird asked, &#8220;who cared for
her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were alone,&#8221; answered Latimer. &#8220;I did not know
whom to call. I read medical books&mdash;for hours each day
I read them. I thought that perhaps I might be able to do&mdash;what
was necessary. But on the night she was taken ill&mdash;I
was stricken with terror. She was so young and childlike&mdash;she
had lived through months of torture&mdash;the agony
seemed so unnatural to me, that I knew I must go for help&mdash;that
I was not mentally calm enough to go through the
ordeal. A strange chance took me to a man who had years
before studied medicine as a profession. He was a singular
being, totally unlike his fellows. He came to her. She died
with her hand in his.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the child die too?&#8221; Baird asked, after a pause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it lived. After she was laid in the earth on the
hillside, I came away. It was the next day, and I was not
sane. I had forgotten the child existed, and had made no
plans for it. The man I spoke of&mdash;he was unmarried and
lonely, and a strange, huge creature of a splendid humaneness&mdash;he
had stood by me through all&mdash;a mountain of
strength&mdash;the man came to my rescue there and took the
child. It would be safe with him. I know nothing more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you not know his name?&#8221; Baird asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he was called Dwillerby by the country people.
I think he had been born a gentleman, though he lived
as the mountaineers did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Afterwards,&#8221; said Baird, &#8220;you went abroad as you had
planned?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I invented the story of her death. I wrote the
details carefully. I learned them as a lesson. It has been
my mother&#8217;s comfort&mdash;that story of the last day&mdash;the open
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
window&mdash;the passing peasants&mdash;the setting sun&mdash;I can see
it all myself. That is my lie. Did you suspect it when I
told it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, God knows!&#8221; Baird answered. &#8220;I did not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never?&#8221; inquired Latimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I have thought was that you had suffered much
more than you wished your mother to know; that&mdash;perhaps&mdash;your
sister had suffered more than you would reveal; and
that you dreaded with all your being the telling of the story.
But never such tragedy as this&mdash;never&mdash;never!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man&mdash;the man who wrought that tragedy,&#8221; began
Latimer, staring darkly before him, &#8220;somewhere he stands
to-night&mdash;unless his day is done. Somewhere he stands&mdash;as
real a man as <i>you</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With all his load upon him,&#8221; said Baird; &#8220;and he may
have loved her passionately.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It should be a heavy load,&#8221; said Latimer, with bitter
gloom; &#8220;heavy&mdash;heavy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not once uttered his name,&#8221; said Baird, the
thought coming to him suddenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Latimer; &#8220;I never knew it. She prayed so
piteously that I would let her hide it. She knelt and sobbed
upon my knee, praying that I would spare her that one woe.
I could spare her no other, so I gave way. She thanked me,
clinging to me and kissing my hand. Ah, her young, young
heart wrung with sobs and tears!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He flung himself forward against the table, hiding his face
upon his arms, and wept aloud. Baird went and stood by
him. He did not speak a word or lay his hand upon the
shaking shoulders. He stood and gazed, his own chest heaving
and awful tears in his eyes.

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>

<p>In later years, one at least of the two men never glanced
back upon the months which followed without a shudder.
And yet outwardly no change took place in their relations,
unless they seemed drawn closer. Such a secret being shared
between two people must either separate or bind them together.
In this case it became a bond. They spoke of it
but little, yet each was well aware that the other remembered
often. Sometimes, when they sat together, Latimer recognised
in Baird&#8217;s eyes a look of brooding and felt that he
knew what his thought was; sometimes Baird, glancing at
his friend, found his face darkened by reverie, and understood.
Once, when this was the case, he said, suddenly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your feeling about&mdash;the man? Do you wish
to kill him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too late,&#8221; Latimer answered. &#8220;It would undo
nothing. If by doing it I could bring her back as she was
before she had seen his face&mdash;if I could see her again, the
pretty, happy child, with eyes like blue convolvulus, and
laughing lips&mdash;I would kill him and gladly hang for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So would I,&#8221; said Baird, grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To crucify him would not <i>undo</i> it,&#8221; said Latimer, looking
sickly pale. &#8220;She was crucified&mdash;she lived through terror
and shame; she died&mdash;afraid that God would not forgive
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That God would not&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221; Baird gasped.
</p>
<p>Latimer&#8217;s bony hands were twisted together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were brought up to believe things like that,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
&#8220;I was afraid, too. That was the damnable part of it. I
could not help her. I have changed since then&mdash;I have
changed through knowing you. As children we had always
been threatened with the just God! The most successful
preachers gained their power by painting pictures of the
torments of hell. That was the fashion then,&#8221; smiling horribly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a wonderful thing that even the fashion in Gods
changes. When we were shut up together in the cabin on
the hillside, she used to be overwhelmed by paroxysms of
fear. She read the Bible a great deal&mdash;because sinners who
wanted to repent always read it&mdash;and sometimes she would
come upon threats and curses, and cry out and turn white
and begin to shiver. Then she would beg me to pray and
pray with her. And we would kneel down on the bare floor
and pray together. My prayers were worse than useless.
What could I say? I was a black sinner, too&mdash;a man who
was perjuring his soul with lies&mdash;and they were told and
acted for her sake, and she knew it. She used to cling about
my neck and beg me to betray her&mdash;to whiten my soul by
confession&mdash;not to allow her wickedness to destroy me&mdash;because
she loved me&mdash;loved me. &#8216;Go back to them and tell
them, Lucien,&#8217; she would cry, &#8216;I will go with you if I
ought&mdash;I have been wicked&mdash;not you&mdash;I have been shameful;
I must bear it&mdash;I must bear it.&#8217; But she could not
bear it. She died.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you never able to give her any comfort?&#8221; said
Baird. His eyes were wet, and he spoke as in bitter appeal.
&#8220;This had been a child in her teens entrapped into bearing
the curse of the world with all its results of mental horror
and physical agony.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What comfort could I give?&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;My
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
religion and my social creed had taught me that she was a
vile sinner&mdash;the worst and most shameful of sinners&mdash;and
that I was a criminal for striving to save her from the consequences
of her sin. I was defying the law of the just God,
who would have punished her with heart-break and open
shame. He would not have spared her, and He would not
spare me since I so strove against Him. The night she
died&mdash;through the long hours of horrible, unnatural convulsions
of pain&mdash;when cold sweat stood in drops on her
deathly childish face, she would clutch my hands and cry
out: &#8216;Eternal torments! For ever and ever and ever&mdash;could
it be like this, Lucien&mdash;for ever and ever and ever?&#8217; Then
she would sob out, &#8216;God! God! God!&#8217; in terrible, helpless
prayer. She had not strength for other words.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird sprang to his feet and thrust out his hand, averting
his pallid face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me any more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I cannot&mdash;I cannot
bear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>She</i> bore it,&#8221; said Latimer, &#8220;until death ended it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there no one&mdash;to save her?&#8221; Baird cried. &#8220;Was
she terrified like that when she died?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man who afterwards took her child&mdash;the man
D&#8217;Willerby,&#8221; Latimer answered, &#8220;was a kindly soul. At
the last moment he took her poor little hand and patted it,
and told her not to be frightened. She turned to him as
if for refuge. He had a big, mellow voice, and a tender,
protecting way. He said: &#8216;Don&#8217;t be frightened. It&#8217;s all
right,&#8217; and his were the last words she heard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless the fellow, wheresoever he is!&#8221; Baird exclaimed.
&#8220;I should like to grasp his hand.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The Reverend John Baird delivered his lectures in many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
cities that year. The discussion they gave rise to had the
natural result of awakening a keen interest in them. There
were excellent souls who misinterpreted and deplored them,
there were excellent souls who condemned; there were even
ministers of the gospel who preached against the man as
an iconoclast and a pagan, and forbade their congregations
to join his audiences. But his lecture-halls were always
crowded, and the hundreds of faces upturned to him when
he arose upon his platform were the faces of eager, breathless,
yearning creatures. He was a man speaking to men,
not an echo of old creeds. He uttered no threats, he painted
no hells, he called aloud to that God in man which is his
soul.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That God which is in you&mdash;in me,&#8221; he proclaimed, &#8220;has
lain dormant because undeveloped man, having made for
himself in the dark ages gods of wood and stone, demanding
awful sacrifice, called forth for himself later a deity as material,
though embodied in no physical form&mdash;a God of vengeance
and everlasting punishments. This is the man-created
deity, and in his name man has so clamoured that the
God which is man&#8217;s soul has been silenced. Let this God
rise, and He will so demand justice and noble mercy from
all creatures to their fellows that temptation and suffering
will cease. What! can we do no good deed without the
promise of paradise as reward? Can we refrain from no
evil unless we are driven to it by the threat of hell? Are
we such base traffickers that we make merchandise of our
souls and bargain for them across a counter? Let us awake!
I say to you from the deepest depths of my aching soul&mdash;if
there were no God to bargain with, then all the more awful
need that each man constitute himself a god&mdash;of justice,
pity, and mercy&mdash;until the world&#8217;s wounds are healed and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
each human thing can stand erect and claim the joy of life
which is his own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On the morning of the day he said these words to the
crowd which had flocked to hear him, he had talked long
with Latimer. For some weeks he had not been strong.
The passion of intensity which ruled him when he spoke to
his audiences was too strong an emotion to leave no physical
trace. After a lecture or sermon he was often pallid and
shaken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have things to say,&#8221; he exclaimed feverishly to Latimer.
&#8220;There are things which must be said. The spoken
word lives&mdash;for good or evil. It is a sound sent echoing
through all the ages to come. Some men have awakened
echoes which have thrilled throughout the world. To speak
one&#8217;s thought&mdash;to use mere words&mdash;it seems such a small
thing&mdash;and yet it is my conviction that nothing which is
said is really ever forgotten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And his face was white, his eyes burning, when at night
he leaned forward to fling forth to his hearers his final arraignment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say to you, were there no God to bargain with, then
all the more awful need that each man constitute himself
a god of justice, pity, and mercy&mdash;until the world&#8217;s wounds
are healed and each human thing can stand erect and claim
the joy of life which is his own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The people went away after the lecture, murmuring
among themselves. Some of them carried away awakening
in their eyes. They all spoke of the man himself; of his
compelling power, the fire of meaning in his face, and the
musical, far-reaching voice, which carried to the remotest
corner of the most crowded buildings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not only his words one is reached by,&#8221; it was said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
&#8220;It is the man&#8217;s self. Truly, he cries out from the depths
of his soul.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was true. It was the man himself. Nature had
armed him well&mdash;with strength, with magnetic force, with
a tragic sense of the anguish of things, and with that brain
which labours far in advance of the thought of the hour.
Men with such brains&mdash;brains which work fiercely and unceasingly
even in their own despite&mdash;reach conclusions not
yet arrived at by their world, and are called iconoclasts.
Some are madly overpraised, some have been made martyrs,
but their spoken word passes onward, and if not in their
own day, in that to-morrow which is the to-day of other
men, the truth of their harvest is garnered and bound into
sheaves.
</p>
<p>At the closing of his lectures, men and women crowded
about him to speak to him, to grasp his hand. When they
were hysterical in their laudations, his grace and readiness
controlled them; when they were direct and earnest, he
found words to say which they could draw aid from later.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I developing&mdash;or degenerating&mdash;into a popular
preacher?&#8221; he said once, with a half restless laugh, to his
shadow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not popular,&#8221; was Latimer&#8217;s answer. &#8220;Popular
is not the word. You are proclaiming too new and bold
a creed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said Baird. &#8220;The pioneer is not popular.
When he forces his way into new countries he encounters
the natives. Sometimes they eat him&mdash;sometimes they drive
him back with poisoned arrows. The country is their own;
they have their own gods, their own language. Why should
a stranger enter in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is no record yet of a pioneer who lived&mdash;or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
died&mdash;in vain,&#8221; said Latimer. &#8220;Some day&mdash;some
day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped and gazed at his friend, brooding. His love
for him was a strong and deep thing. It grew with each
hour they spent together, with each word he heard him
speak. Baird was his mental nourishment and solace. When
they were apart he found his mind dwelling on him as a
sort of habit. But for this one man he would have lived
a squalid life among his people at Janney&#8217;s Mills&mdash;squalid
because he had not the elasticity to rise above its narrow,
uneducated dullness. The squalor so far as he himself was
concerned was not physical. His own small, plain home
was as neat as it was simple, but he had not the temperament
which makes a man friends. Baird possessed this temperament,
and his home was a centre of all that was most living.
It was not the ordinary Willowfield household. The larger
outer world came and went. When Latimer went to it he
was swept on by new currents and felt himself warmed and
fed.
</p>
<p>There had been scarcely any day during years in which
the two men had not met. They had made journeys together;
they had read the same books and encountered the
same minds. Each man clung to the intimacy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want this thing,&#8221; Baird had said more than once; &#8220;if
you want it, I want it more. Nothing must rob us of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The time has come&mdash;it came long ago&mdash;&#8221; his Shadow
said, &#8220;when I could not live without it. My life has grown
to yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Latimer&#8217;s pleasure that he found he could be an
aid to the man who counted for so much to him. Affairs
which pressed upon Baird he would take in hand; he was
able to transact business for him, to help him in the development
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
of his plans, save him frequently both time and fatigue.
It fell about that when the lectures were delivered
at distant points the two men journeyed together.
</p>
<p>Latimer entered Baird&#8217;s library on one occasion just as
a sharp-faced, rather theatrical-looking man left it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll let me know your decision, sir, as soon as possible,&#8221;
the stranger departed, saying. &#8220;These things ought
always to be developed just at the right moment. This is
your right moment. Everybody is talking you over, one
way or another.&#8221; When the stranger was gone, Baird explained
his presence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is an agent,&#8221; he said; &#8220;he proposes that I shall
lecture through the States. I&mdash;don&#8217;t know,&#8221; as if pondering
the thing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The things you say should be said to many,&#8221; remarked
Latimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The more the better,&#8221; said Baird, reflectively; &#8220;I know
that&mdash;the more the better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They sat and talked the matter over at length. The
objections to it were neither numerous nor serious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I want to say these things,&#8221; said Baird, a little
feverishly. &#8220;I want to say them again and again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before they parted for the night it was decided that he
should accede to the proposal, and that Latimer should
arrange to be his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the lecture &#8216;Repentance,&#8217; he tells me, is most in
demand,&#8221; Baird said, as he walked to the door, with a hand
in Latimer&#8217;s.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
</div>

<p>Frequenters of the Capitol&mdash;whether loungers or politicians&mdash;had
soon become familiar with the figure of one
of the De Willoughby claimants. It was too large a figure
not to be quickly marked and unavoidably remembered.
Big Tom slowly mounting the marble steps or standing on
the corridors was an object to attract attention, and inquiries
being answered by the information that he was a party to
one of the largest claims yet made, he not unnaturally was
discussed with interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s from the depths of the mountains of North Carolina,&#8221;
it was explained; &#8220;he keeps a cross-roads store and
post-office, but he has some of the best blood of the South
in his veins, and his claim is enormous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he gain it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows? He has mortgaged all he owns to make
the effort. The claim is inherited from his father, Judge
De Willoughby, who died at the close of the war. As he
lived and died within the Confederacy, the Government
holds that he was disloyal and means to make the most
of it. The claimants hold that they can prove him loyal.
They&#8217;ll have to prove it thoroughly. The Government is
growing restive over the claims of Southerners, and there
is bitter opposition to be overcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Lyman nearly lost his last election because he had
favoured a Southern claim in his previous term. His constituents
are country patriots, and they said they weren&#8217;t
sending a man to Congress to vote for Rebs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble. When men&#8217;s votes are endangered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
by a course of action they grow ultra-conservative. A vote&#8217;s
a vote.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That was the difficulty, as Tom found. A vote was a
vote. The bitterness of war had not yet receded far enough
into the past to allow of unprejudiced judgment. Members
of political parties were still enemies, wrongs still rankled,
graves were yet new, wounds still ached and burned. Men
who had found it to their interest to keep at fever heat
the fierce spirit of the past four years of struggle and bloodshed,
were not willing to relinquish the tactics which had
brought fortunes to them. The higher-minded were determined
that where justice was done it should be done where
it was justice alone, clearly proved to be so. There had been
too many false and idle claims brought forward to admit
of the true ones being accepted without investigation and
delay. In the days when old Judge De Willoughby had
walked through the streets of Delisleville, ostracized and
almost hooted as he passed among those who had once been
his friends, it would not have been difficult to prove that
he was loyal to the detested Government, but in these later
times, when the old man lay quiet in what his few remaining
contemporaries still chose to consider a dishonoured grave,
undeniable proof of a loyalty which now would tend to the
honour and advantage of those who were of his blood was
not easy to produce.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man lived and died in the Confederacy,&#8221; was said
by those who were in power in Washington.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was constructively a rebel. We want proof&mdash;proof.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Most of those who might have furnished it if they would,
were either scattered as to the four winds of the earth, or
were determined to give no aid in the matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A Southerner who deserted the South in its desperate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
struggle for life need not come to Southern gentlemen to
ask them to help him to claim the price of his infamy.&#8221;
That was the Delisleville point of view, and it was difficult
to cope with. If Tom had been a rich man and could have
journeyed between Delisleville and the Capital, or wheresoever
the demands of his case called him, to see and argue
with this man or that, the situation would have simplified
itself somewhat, though there would still have remained
obstacles to be overcome.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But a man who has hard work to look his room rent
in the face, and knows he can&#8217;t do that for more than a few
months, is in a tight place,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Evidence that will
satisfy the Government isn&#8217;t easily collected in Dupont Circle.
These fellows have heard men talk before. They&#8217;ve
heard too many men talk. There&#8217;s Stamps, now&mdash;they&#8217;ve
heard Stamps talk. Stamps is way ahead of me where lobbying
is concerned. He knows the law, and he doesn&#8217;t mind
having doors shut in his face or being kicked into the street,
so long as he sees a chance of getting indemnified for his
&#8216;herds of cattle.&#8217; I&#8217;m not a business man, and I mind a
lot of things that don&#8217;t trouble him. I&#8217;m not a good hand
at asking favours and sitting down to talk steadily for a
solid hour to a man who doesn&#8217;t want to hear me and hasn&#8217;t
five minutes to spare.&#8221; But for Rupert and Sheba he would
have given up the claim in a week and gone back to Talbot&#8217;s
Cross-roads content to end his days as he began them when
he opened the store&mdash;living in the little back rooms on beans
and bacon and friend chicken and hominy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That suited me well enough,&#8221; he used to say to himself,
when he thought the thing over. &#8220;There were times when
I found it a bit lonely&mdash;but, good Lord! loneliness is a
small thing for a man to complain of in a world like this.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
It isn&#8217;t fits or starvation. When a man&#8217;s outlived the habit
of expecting happiness, it doesn&#8217;t take much to keep him
going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But at his side was eager youth which had outlived nothing,
which believed in a future full of satisfied yearnings
and radiant joys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not alone now,&#8221; said Rupert; &#8220;I must make a
place and a home for Sheba. I must not be only a boy
in love with her; I must be a man who can protect her from
everything&mdash;from everything. She is so sweet&mdash;she is so
sweet. She makes me feel that I am a man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was sweet. To big Tom they were both sweet in
their youth and radiant faith and capabilities for happiness.
They seemed like children, and the tender bud of their
lovely young passion was a thing to be cherished. He had
seen such buds before, but he had never seen the flower.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see the flower,&#8221; he used to say to himself.
&#8220;To see it would pay a man for a good deal he&#8217;d missed
himself. The pair of them could set up a pretty fair garden
of Eden&mdash;serpents and apple-trees being excluded.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were happy. Even when disappointments befell
them and prospects were unpromising they were happy.
They could look into each other&#8217;s eyes and take comfort.
Rupert&#8217;s dark moods had melted away. He sometimes forgot
they had ever ruled him. His old boyish craving for
love and home was fed. The bare little rooms in the poor
little house were home. Sheba and Tom were love and
affection. When they sat at the table and calculated how
much longer their diminishing store would last, even as it
grew smaller and smaller, they could laugh over the sums
they worked out on slips of paper. So long as the weather
was warm enough they strolled about together in the fragrant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
darkness or sat in the creeper-hung porch, in the light
of summer moons; when the cold nights came they sat
about the stove or the table and talked, while Sheba sewed
buttons on or worked assiduously at the repairing of her
small wardrobe. Whatsoever she did, the two men sat and
admired, and there was love and laughter.
</p>
<p>The strenuous life which went on in the busier part of
the town&mdash;the politics, the struggles, the plots and schemes,
the worldly pleasures&mdash;seemed entirely apart from them.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, after a day in which Judge Rutherford had
been encouraged or Tom had had a talk with a friendly
member who had listened to the story of the claim with
signs of interest, they felt their star of hope rising; it never
sinks far below the horizon when one&#8217;s teens are scarcely
of the past&mdash;and Sheba and Rupert spent a wonderful evening
making plans for a future of ease and fortune.
</p>
<p>At Judge Rutherford&#8217;s suggestion, Tom had long sought
an interview with a certain member of the Senate whose
good word would be a carrying weight in any question under
debate. He was a shrewd, honest, business-like man, and
a personal friend of the President&#8217;s. He was much pursued
by honest and dishonest alike, and, as a result of experience,
had become difficult to reach. On the day Tom was admitted
to see him, he had been more than usually badgered.
Just as Tom approached his door a little man opened it
cautiously and slid out, with the air of one leaving within
the apartment things not exhilarating on retrospect. He
was an undersized country man, the cut of whose jeans
wore a familiar air to Tom&#8217;s eye even at a distance and
before he lifted the countenance which revealed him as
Mr. Stamps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t a-gwine to do your job no good to-day, Tom,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
he said, benignly. &#8220;He&#8217;d &#8216;a&#8217; kicked me out ef I hadn&#8217;t &#8216;a&#8217;
bin small&mdash;jest same es you was gwine ter that time I
come to talk to ye about Sheby. He&#8217;s a smarter man than
you be, an&#8217; he seed the argyment I hed to p&#8217;int out to you.
Ye won&#8217;t help your job none to-day!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got a &#8216;job&#8217; in hand,&#8221; Tom answered; &#8220;your
herds of stock and the Judge&#8217;s coal mines and cotton fields
are different matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He passed on and saw that when his name was announced
the Senator looked up from his work with a fretted movement
of the head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. De Willoughby of Talbot&#8217;s Cross-roads?&#8221; he said.
Tom bowed. He became conscious of appearing to occupy
too much space in the room of a busy man who had plainly
been irritated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told by Judge Rutherford that you had kindly
consented to see me,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>The Senator tapped the table nervously with his pencil
and pushed some papers aside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I find I have no time to spare this morning,&#8221; was
his brutally frank response. &#8220;I have just been forced to
give the time which might have been yours to a little hoosier
who made his way in, heaven knows how, and refused to be
ordered out. He had a claim, too, and came from your
county and said he was an old friend of yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not an old enemy,&#8221; answered Tom. &#8220;There is
that much foundation in the statement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he has occupied the time I had meant to give you,&#8221;
said the Senator, &#8220;and I was not prepossessed either by
himself or his claim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s a man to gain a claim,&#8221; said Tom; &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid I&#8217;m not.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is fair to warn you that I am not friendly to claims
made by the families of men who lived in a hot-bed of
secession,&#8221; said the Senator. He had been badgered too
much this morning, and this big, rather convincing looking
applicant worried him. &#8220;I have an appointment at the
White House in ten minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then this is no place for me,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;No man
is likely to be friendly to a thing he has no time to talk
of. I will bid you good-morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; returned the Senator, brusquely.
</p>
<p>Tom went away feeling that he was a blunderer. The
fact was that he was a neophyte and, it was true, did not
possess the qualities which make a successful lobbyist. Mr.
Stamps had wheedled or forced his way into the great man&#8217;s
apartment and had persisted in remaining to press his claim
until he was figuratively turned out by the shoulders. Big
Tom had used only such means to obtain the interview as
a gentleman might; he had waited until he was called to
take his turn, and so had lost his chance. When he had
found the Senator hurried and unwilling to spend time on
him he had withdrawn at once, not feeling Mr. Stamps&#8217;s
method to be possible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I ought to have stayed and buttonholed him
in spite of himself,&#8221; he thought, ruefully. &#8220;I&#8217;m a greenhorn;
I suppose a man in my place ought to stand his
ground whether it&#8217;s decent or indecent, and make people
listen to what he has to say, and be quite willing to be kicked
downstairs after he has said it. I&#8217;m a disgrace to my species&mdash;and
I don&#8217;t think much of the species.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he was walking through one of the corridors he saw
before him two men who were evidently visitors to the
place. He gathered this from their leisurely movements
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
and the interest with which they regarded the objects about
them. They looked at pictures and remarked upon decorations.
One was a man who was unusually well-built. He
was tall and moved well and had lightly silvered hair; his
companion was tall also, but badly hung together, and
walked with a stoop of the shoulders.
</p>
<p>Tom walked behind them for some yards before his attention
was really arrested, but suddenly a movement of
one man&#8217;s head seemed to recall some memory of the past.
He did not know what the memory was, but he knew vaguely
that it was a memory. He followed a few yards further,
wondering idly what had been recalled and why he should
be reminded of the mountains and the pine-trees. Yes, it
was the mountains and pine-trees&mdash;Hamlin County, but not
the Hamlin County of to-day. Why not the Hamlin County
of to-day? why something which seemed more remote?
Confound the fellow; he had made that movement again.
Tom wished he would turn his face that he might see it,
and he hurried his footsteps somewhat that he might come
within nearer range. The two men paused with their backs
towards him, and Tom paused also. They were looking
at a picture, and the taller of the two made a gesture with
his hand. It was a long, bony hand, and as he extended
it Tom slightly started. It all came back to him&mdash;the memory
which had been recalled. He smelt the scent of the
pines on the hillside; he saw the little crowd of mourners
about the cabin door; inside, women sat with bent heads,
upon two wooden chairs rested the ends of a slender coffin,
and by it stood a man who lifted his hand and said to those
about him: &#8220;Let us pray.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The years swept back as he stood there. He was face to
face again with the tragic mystery which had seemed to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
end in utter silence. The man turned his face so that it
was plainly to be seen&mdash;sallow, rugged, harsh in line. The
same face, though older, and perhaps less tragic&mdash;the face
of the man he had left alone in the awful, desolate stillness
of the empty room.
</p>
<p>The next moment he turned away again. He and his
companion passed round a corner and were gone. Tom
made no attempt to follow them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no reason why I should,&#8221; was his thought,
&#8220;either for Sheba&#8217;s sake or his own. She is happy, and
he feels his secret safe&mdash;whatsoever it may have been. Perhaps
he has had time to outlive the misery of it, and it
would all be brought to life again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the incident had been a shock. There was nothing
to fear from it, he knew; but it had been a shock nevertheless.
He did not know the man&#8217;s name; he had never
asked it. He was plainly one of the many strangers who,
in passing through the Capital, went to visit the public buildings.
The merest chance might have brought him to the
place; the most ordinary course of events might take him
away. Tom went back to Dupont Circle in a thoughtful
mood. He forgot the claim and the Senator who had had
no leisure to hear the statement of his case.
</p>
<p>Rupert and Sheba were waiting for his return. Rupert
had spent the afternoon searching for employment. He
had spent many a long day in the same way and with the
same result.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t want me,&#8221; he had said when he came home.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t want me anywhere, it seems&mdash;either in lawyers&#8217;
offices or dry-goods stores. I have not been particular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had sat down and gazed at each other.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I sometimes wonder,&#8221; said Sheba, &#8220;what we shall do
when all our money is gone&mdash;every penny of it. It cannot
last long now. We cannot stay here and we cannot pay
our way back to the mountains. What shall we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall go out every day till I find something to do,&#8221;
said Rupert, with the undiscouraged fervour of youth. &#8220;I
am not looking for employment for a gentleman, in these
days; I am looking for work&mdash;just as Uncle Matt is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He chopped some wood yesterday and brought home
two dollars,&#8221; Sheba said. &#8220;He made me take it. He said
he wanted to pay his &#8216;bode.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed a little, but her eyes were wet and shining.
</p>
<p>Rupert took her face between his hands and looked into
it adoringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened, Sheba,&#8221; he said; &#8220;don&#8217;t be unhappy.
Lovely darling, I will take care of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She pressed her soft cheek against his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you will,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and of Uncle Tom, too.
I couldn&#8217;t be unhappy&mdash;we all three love each other so.
I do not believe we shall be unhappy, even if we are poor
enough to be hungry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So their moment of dismay ended in smiles. They were
passing through a phase of life in which it is not easy
to be unhappy. Somehow things always brightened when
they drew near each other. His observation of this truth
was one of Tom&#8217;s pleasures. He knew the year of waiting
had managed to fill itself with sweetness for them. Their
hopes had been alternately raised and dashed to earth; one
day it seemed not improbable that they were to be millionaires,
the next that beggary awaited them after the dwindling
of their small stock of money; but they had shared
their emotions and borne their vicissitudes together.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span></p>
<p>When Tom entered the room they rose and met him with
questioning faces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it good fortune?&#8221; they cried. &#8220;Did you see him,
Uncle Tom? What did he say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He told his story as lightly as possible, but it could not
be transformed, by any lightness of touch, into an encouraging
episode. He made a picture of Stamps sidling through
the barely opened door, and was terse and witty at the
expense of his own discomfiture and consciousness of incompetence.
He laughed at himself and made them laugh,
but when he sat down in his accustomed seat there was a
shade upon his face.
</p>
<p>The children exchanged glances, the eyes of each prompting
the other. They must be at their brightest. They
knew the sight of their happiness warmed and lightened
his heart always.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is tired and hungry,&#8221; Sheba said. &#8220;We must give
him a beautiful hot supper. Rupert, we must set the table.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had grown used to waiting upon themselves, and
their domestic services wore more or less the air of festivities.
Sheba ran downstairs to Miss Burford&#8217;s kitchen, where
Uncle Matt had prepared the evening meal in his best manner.
As the repasts grew more and more simple, Matt
seemed to display greater accomplishments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very well, Miss Sheba,&#8221; he had said once, when
she praised the skill with which he employed his scant resources.
&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty easy to be a good cook when you&#8217;se
got everythin&#8217; right to han&#8217;. The giftness is to git up a fine
table when you ain&#8217;t got nuffin&#8217;. Dat&#8217;s whar dish yer niggah
likes to show out. De Lard knows I&#8217;se got too much yere
dis ve&#8217;y minnit&mdash;to be a-doin&#8217; credit to my &#8217;sperience&mdash;too
much, Miss Sheba.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></p>
<p>He was frying hoe-cake and talking to Miss Burford when
Sheba came into the kitchen. He was a great comfort and
aid to Miss Burford, and in a genteel way the old lady found
him a resource in the matters of companionship and conversation.
Her life was too pinched and narrow to allow
her even the simpler pleasure of social intercourse, and
Matt&#8217;s journeys into the world, and his small adventures,
and his comments upon politics and social events were a
solace and a source of entertainment to her.
</p>
<p>Just now he was describing to her the stories he had heard
of a celebrated lecturer who had just arrived in the city.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether he&#8217;s a &#8217;vivalist or jes&#8217; a plain preacher what
folks is runnin&#8217; after, I cayn&#8217;t quite make out, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
he was saying. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t quite thinkin&#8217; he&#8217;s a &#8217;vivalist, but
de peoples is a-runnin&#8217; after him shore&mdash;an&#8217; seems like
dey doin&#8217; it in ev&#8217;y city he goes to. Ev&#8217;ybody want to heah
him&mdash;ev&#8217;ybody&mdash;rich en pore&mdash;young en ole. De Rev&#8217;end
John Baird&#8217;s his name, an&#8217; he&#8217;s got a fren&#8217; travellin&#8217; with
him as they say is like Jonathan was to David in dese yere
ole Bible times. An&#8217; I heern tell ev when he rise in de
pulpit de people&#8217;s jest gets so worked up at what he preach
to &#8217;em&mdash;dey jest cries an&#8217; rocks de benches. Dat&#8217;s what
make me think he might be a &#8217;vivalist&mdash;cos we all knows
dat cryin&#8217; an&#8217; rockin&#8217; an&#8217; clappin&#8217; hands is what makes a
&#8217;vival.&#8221; He was full of anecdotes concerning the new arrival
whose reputation had plainly preceded him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He gwine ter preach nex&#8217; Sat&#8217;day on &#8216;&#8217;Pentance,&#8217;&#8221; he
said to Sheba, with a chuckle. &#8220;Dat&#8217;s his big lecture ev&#8217;ybody
want to hear. De hall shore to be pack full. What
I&#8217;m a-hopin&#8217; is dat it&#8217;ll be pack full er Senators an&#8217; members
er Congrest, an&#8217; he&#8217;ll set some of &#8217;em a-&#8217;pentin&#8217;, dey ain&#8217;t
&#8217;tend to dere business an&#8217; git people&#8217;s claims through. Ef
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
I know&#8217;d de gen&#8217;leman, I&#8217;d ax him to menshun dat special
an&#8217; pertickler.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they sat at supper, Sheba repeated his stories and comments.
All the comments were worthy of repetition, and
most of the anecdotes were suggestively interesting, illustrating,
as they did, the power of a single man over many.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to go and hear him myself,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Uncle Tom, have you anything to repent? Rupert, have
you? Uncle Tom, you have not forgotten the Senator.
You look at me as if you were thinking of something that
was not happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Senator was not particularly happy,&#8221; remarked
Tom. &#8220;He had just had an interview with Stamps, and
he certainly was not happy at the sight of me. He thought
he had another on his hands. He&#8217;s in better spirits by this
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheba got up and went to his side of the table. She put
her arms round his neck and pressed her cheek against his.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget about him,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not remembering him particularly,&#8221; said Tom, the
shade passing from his eyes; &#8220;I am remembering you&mdash;as
you were nineteen years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nineteen years ago!&#8221; said Sheba. &#8220;I was a baby!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Tom, folding a big arm round her, and
speaking slowly. &#8220;I saw a man to-day who reminded me
of the day you were born. Are you glad you were born,
Sheba? that&#8217;s what I want to be sure of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two pairs of young eyes met glowing. Tom knew
they had met, by the warmth of the soft cheek touching him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am glad&mdash;I am glad&mdash;I am glad!&#8221; with grateful
sweetness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&mdash;and I,&#8221; cried Rupert. He sprung up and held
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
out an impetuous boyish hand to Tom. &#8220;You know how
glad, Uncle Tom&mdash;look at her&mdash;look at me&mdash;see how glad
we both are; and it is you&mdash;you who have made it so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty big thing,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;that two people
should be glad they are alive.&#8221; And he grasped the ardent
hand as affectionately as it was offered.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
</div>

<p>The Reverend John Baird and his friend the Reverend
Lucien Latimer were lodged in a quiet house in a quiet
street. The lecturing tour had been fatiguing, and Baird
was glad of such repose as he could secure. In truth, the
excitement and strain of his work, the journeying from
place to place, the hospitalities from which he could not
escape, had worn upon him. He had grown thinner, and
often did not sleep well at night. He used to find himself
lying awake repeating to himself mechanically words from
his own lecture. &#8220;Repentance is too late,&#8221; his voice would
whisper to the darkness. &#8220;Repentance cannot undo.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His audiences found him an irresistible force. He had
become more than the fashion of the hour; he was its passion.
People liked to look at as well as to hear him. He
was besieged by lion-hunters, overwhelmed with attentions
in each town or city he visited. Reporters followed him,
interviewers besought appointments, agreeable people invited
him to their houses, intrusive people dogged him. Latimer
stood between him and as many fatigues as he could.
He transacted business for him, and interviewed interviewers;
and he went to tiring functions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I enter a room without you, and make your excuses,
they must make the most of my black face; and they
make the most of it, but they don&#8217;t love me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Still
it is a thing to be borne if it saves you when you need all
your forces. What does it matter? I have never expected
to be smiled at for my own sake as they smile at me for
yours.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>In these days of close companionship each found in each
new qualities increasing the tie between them. Latimer
felt himself fed by the public affection surrounding the
man who was his friend. He was thrilled by the applause
which thundered forth at his words; he was moved by the
mere sense of his success, and the power he saw him unknowingly
exercise through mere physical charm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am nearer being a happy, or at least a peaceful, man
than I had ever thought to be,&#8221; he said to Baird; &#8220;your
life seems to fill mine, and I am less lonely.&#8221; Which was
indeed a truth.
</p>
<p>On the evening of the day on which big Tom had caught
his glimpse of the two strangers in the corridor of the Capitol,
Baird dined at the house of the Senator, whose adverse
mood had promised such small encouragement to the De
Willoughby claim. And in the course of the meal the host
spoke of both claim and claimants.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man is a sort of Colossus,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and he looked
all the heavier and bigger because my last visitor had been
the smallest and most insignificant of the hoosier type.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this man a hoosier?&#8221; was asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He has lived among the most primitive, and Rutherford
tells me is a sort of county institution; but he is not
a hoosier. He has a large, humane, humorous face, and
a big, humorous, mellow voice. I should rather have liked
the fellow, confound him, if I hadn&#8217;t lost my patience before
he came into the room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he tell you the story of the claim?&#8221; enquired his
married daughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t let him. I was feeling pretty sick of
claims, and I had no time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, father, I wish you had let him tell it,&#8221; exclaimed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
the pretty young woman. &#8220;The truth is, I am beginning
to be interested in that claim myself. I am in love with
Judge Rutherford and his stories of Jenny and Tom Scott.
His whole soul is bound up in &#8216;pushing this thing through&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s
what he calls it. He is the most delightful lobbyist
I ever met. He is like a bull in a china shop&mdash;though I
don&#8217;t believe anyone ever saw a bull in a china shop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He does not know enough to give his friends a rest,&#8221;
said the Senator. &#8220;If he was not such a good fellow he
would bore a man to death. He bores many a man as it is,
and people in office won&#8217;t stand being bored. He&#8217;s too
ingenuous. The shrewd ones say his ingenuousness is too
good to be true. He can&#8217;t keep De Willoughby&#8217;s virtues
out of his stories of him&mdash;and a man&#8217;s virtues have nothing
much to do with his claim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I met him in one of the squares yesterday,&#8221; said Mrs.
Meredith, &#8220;and he almost cried when he spoke of the claim.
He told me that everything was going wrong&mdash;that it was
being pushed aside by all sorts of things, and he had lost
heart. His eyes and nose got quite red, and he had to wink
hard to keep back the tears.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow believes in it, at any rate,&#8221; said the Senator;
&#8220;he has that to support him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He believes in everything,&#8221; said Mrs. Meredith, &#8220;and
it would have touched your heart to hear him talk about
the claimants. There is a young nephew and a beautiful
girl creature, who is big Mr. De Willoughby&#8217;s adopted
daughter. She is not a claimant, it is true, but they all
adore each other, and the nephew is in love with her; and
if the claim goes through they will be happy forever afterwards.
I saw the nephew once, and he was a beautiful boy
with Southern eyes and a charming expression. Upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
whole, I think I am in love with the young couple, too.
Their story sounded like a pastoral poem when Judge Rutherford
told it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you tell it to us, Marion,&#8221; said the Senator,
with a laugh, and a glance round the table. &#8220;It may appeal
to our feelings and advance the interests of the
claim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray, tell it, Mrs. Meredith,&#8221; Baird put in; &#8220;the mere
mention of it has appealed to my emotions. Perhaps Senator
Harburton and Mr. Lewis will be moved also, and that
will be two votes to the good&mdash;perhaps more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The charm of it is that it is a story without a plot,&#8221;
Mrs. Meredith said. &#8220;There is nothing in it but youth
and love and innocence and beauty. It is Romeo and Juliet
without the tragedy. Romeo appeared on a moonlight night
in a garden, and Juliet stood upon a balcony among roses&mdash;and
their young souls cried out to each other. It is all so
young and innocent&mdash;they only want to spend their lives
together, like flowers growing side by side. They want
nothing but each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the claim,&#8221; added the Senator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They cannot have each other if the claim fails. They
will have to starve to death in each other&#8217;s arms like the
&#8216;Babes in the Wood&#8217;; I am sure the robins will come and
cover them with leaves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the big uncle,&#8221; her father asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor fellow,&#8221; Mrs. Meredith said. &#8220;Judge Rutherford
is finest when he enlarges on him. He says, over and over
again, as if it were a kind of argument, &#8216;Tom, now&mdash;Tom,
he wants those two young ones to be happy. He says nature
fixed it all for them, so that they could be happy&mdash;and he
doesn&#8217;t want to see it spoiled. He says love ain&#8217;t treated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
fair, as a rule, and he wants to see it given a show&mdash;a real
show.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>At least one pair of deeply interested listener&#8217;s eyes were
fixed upon her. They were the Reverend John Baird&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be a beautiful thing to see,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One
does not see it. There seems a fate against it. The wrong
people meet, or the right ones do not until it is too late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to see it myself,&#8221; said the host, &#8220;but I am
afraid that the argument&mdash;as an argument&mdash;would not support
a claim on the Government.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to see the claimants and hear all the arguments
they can bring forward,&#8221; was Mrs. Meredith&#8217;s conclusion.
&#8220;I want to see Romeo and Juliet together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I go with you?&#8221; asked Baird.
</p>
<p>Latimer had not come in when he returned to their lodgings.
He also had been out to spend the evening. But
it was not many minutes before Baird heard his latch-key
and the opening of the front door. He came upstairs rather
slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are either ill,&#8221; Baird said, when he entered, &#8220;or
you have met with some shock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it was a shock,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I have been
dragged back into the black pit of twenty years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty years?&#8221; said Baird.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen the man who&mdash;was with us in the hillside
cabin, through that night she died. He passed me in the
street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird stood still and looked at him without speaking.
What was there to be said?
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is such a noticeable looking fellow,&#8221; Latimer went
on, &#8220;that I felt sure I could find out who he was. In the
mountains they called him &#8216;Big Tom D&#8216;Willerby.&#8217; His
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
real name is De Willoughby, and he has been here for some
months in pursuit of a claim, which is a great deal talked
about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The great De Willoughby claim?&#8221; said Baird. &#8220;They
talked of it to-night at dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer tapped the table nervously with the fingers of
an unsteady hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He may be living within a hundred yards of us&mdash;within
a hundred yards,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We may cross each other&#8217;s
path at any moment. I can at least know&mdash;since fate has
brought us together again&mdash;I should never have sought him
out&mdash;but one can know whether&mdash;whether <i>it</i> lived or died.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has with him,&#8221; said Baird, &#8220;a girl of nineteen who
is his adopted daughter. I heard it to-night. She is said
to be a lovely girl who is in love with a lovely boy who is
De Willoughby&#8217;s nephew. She is happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is happy,&#8221; murmured Latimer, biting his livid lips.
He could not bring himself back to the hour he was living
in. He could only see again the bare little room&mdash;he could
hear the cries of terrified anguish. &#8220;It seems strange,&#8221; he
murmured, &#8220;that Margery&#8217;s child should be happy.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
</div>

<p>It was not difficult to discover the abiding place of the
De Willoughby claimants. The time had come when there
were few who did not know who occupied the upper floor
of Miss Burford&#8217;s house near the Circle. Miss Burford
herself had gradually become rather proud of her boarders,
and, as the interest in the case increased, felt herself becoming
a prominent person.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the claim goes through, the De Willoughby family
will be very wealthy,&#8221; she said, genteelly. &#8220;They will return
to their Southern home, no doubt, and restore it to its
fawmah magnificence. Mr. Rupert De Willoughby will
be lawd of the mannah.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She spent many hours&mdash;which she felt to be very aristocratic&mdash;in
listening to Uncle Matt&#8217;s stories of the &#8220;old De
Willoughby place,&#8221; the rice-fields in &#8220;South Ca&#8217;llina,&#8221; and
the &#8220;thousands of acres of gol&#8217; mines&#8221; in the mountains.
There was a rich consolation in mere conversation on the
subject of glories which had once had veritable substance,
and whose magnitude might absolutely increase if fortune
was kind. But it was not through inquiry that Latimer
discovered the whereabouts of the man who shared his
secret. In two days&#8217; time they met face to face on the steps
of the Capitol.
</p>
<p>Latimer was going down them; big Tom was coming up.
The latter was lost in thought on his affairs, and was not
looking at such of his fellow-men as passed him. Suddenly
he found himself one or two steps below someone who held
out a hand and spoke in a low voice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span></p>
<p>&#8220;De Willoughby!&#8221; the stranger exclaimed, and Tom
lifted his eyes and looked straight into those of the man
he had seen last nineteen years before in the cabin at
Blair&#8217;s Hollow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know me again?&#8221; the man asked. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good
many years since we met, and I am not as easy to recognise
as you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know you,&#8221; answered big Tom, grasping the outstretched
hand kindly. &#8220;I saw you a few days ago and
knew you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not see you,&#8221; said Latimer. &#8220;And you did not
speak to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Tom, slowly; &#8220;I thought it over while
I walked behind you, and I made up my mind that it might
do you no good&mdash;and to hold back would do none of us
any harm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None of us?&#8221; questioned Latimer.
</p>
<p>Big Tom put a hand on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you spoke to me of your own free will,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;let&#8217;s go and have a talk. There are plenty of quiet corners
in this place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were seats which were secluded enough, though
people passed and repassed within sight of them. People
often chose such spots to sit and talk together. One
saw pairs of lovers, pairs of politicians, couples of sightseers.
</p>
<p>They found such a seat and sat down. Latimer could
not well control the expression his face wore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None of us?&#8221; he said again.
</p>
<p>Tom still kept a friendly hand on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a beautiful young woman, though she will always
seem more or less of a child to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have kept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
her safe and I&#8217;ve made her happy. That was what I meant
to do. I don&#8217;t believe she has had a sad hour in her life.
What I&#8217;m sick of is seeing people unhappy. I&#8217;ve kept unhappiness
from her. We&#8217;ve loved each other&mdash;that&#8217;s what
we&#8217;ve done. She&#8217;s known nothing but having people about
who were fond of her. They were a simple, ignorant lot
of mountain hoosiers, but, Lord! they loved her and she
loved them. She&#8217;s enjoyed the spring, and she&#8217;s enjoyed
the summer, and she&#8217;s enjoyed the autumn and the winter.
The rainy days haven&#8217;t made her feel dull, and the cold
ones haven&#8217;t made her shiver. That&#8217;s the way she has grown
up&mdash;just like a pretty fawn or a forest tree. Now her young
mate has come, and the pair of them fell deep in love at
sight. They met at the right time and they were the right
pair. It was all so natural that she didn&#8217;t know she was
in love at first. She only knew she was happier every
day. I knew what was the matter, and it made me happy
just to look on. Good lord! <i>how</i> they love each other&mdash;those
children. How they look at each other every minute
without knowing they are doing it; and how they smile
when their eyes meet&mdash;without knowing why. I know why.
It&#8217;s because they are in paradise&mdash;and God knows if it&#8217;s
to be done I&#8217;m going to keep them there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; broke from Latimer. &#8220;What a heart you
have, man!&#8221; He turned his face to look at him almost
as if in reverent awe. &#8220;Margery&#8217;s child! Margery&#8217;s child!&#8221;
he repeated to himself. &#8220;Is she like her mother?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw her mother&mdash;when she was happy,&#8221; Tom
answered. &#8220;She is taller than her mother and has eyes
like a summer morning sky. It&#8217;s a wonderful face. I
sometimes think she must be like&mdash;the other.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see her,&#8221; said Latimer. &#8220;She need know
nothing about me. I want to see her. May I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We are staying here to push our claim, and we
are living near Dupont Circle, and doing it as cheaply as we
can. We haven&#8217;t a cent to spare, but that hasn&#8217;t hurt us
so far. If we win our claim we shall be bloated bondholders;
if we lose it, we shall have to tramp back to the mountains
and build a log hut, and live on nuts and berries until we
can raise a crop. The two young ones will set up a nest
of their own and live like Adam and Eve&mdash;and I swear
they won&#8217;t mind it. They&#8217;d be happy rich, but they&#8217;ll be
happy poor. When would you like to come and see her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come to-morrow?&#8221; asked Latimer. &#8220;And may
I bring a friend with me? He is the human being who is
nearest to me on earth. He is the only living soul who
knows&mdash;what we know. He is the Reverend John Baird.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;The man who is setting the world
on fire with his lectures&mdash;the &#8216;Repentance&#8217; man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll like to see him. No one better. We shall all
like to see him. We have heard a great deal of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They did not part for half an hour. When they did
Latimer knew a great deal of the past. He knew the story
of the child&#8217;s up-growing, with the sun rising from behind
one mountain and setting behind another; he seemed to
know the people who had loved and been familiar with her
throughout her childish and girlish years; he knew of the
fanciful name given her in infancy, and of the more fanciful
one her primitive friends and playmates had adopted. He
knew the story of Rupert, and guessed vaguely at the far
past in which Delia Vanuxem had lived and died.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God I saw you that day!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Thank
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
God I went to you that night!&#8221; And they grasped hands
again and went their separate ways.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Latimer went home and told Baird of the meeting and
of the appointment for the following day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt that you would like to see the man,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;He is the finest, simple being in the world. Soul and body
are on a like scale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were right in thinking I should like to see him,&#8221;
answered Baird. &#8220;I have thought of him often.&#8221; He
regarded his friend with some anxiety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To meet her face to face will be a strange thing,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;Do you think you can hide what you must feel?
It will not be easy&mdash;even for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will not be easy for either of us&mdash;if she looks at us
with Margery&#8217;s eyes. You will know them. Margery was
happy, too, when the picture you have seen was made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That&mdash;to see her stand before them in her youth and
beauty, all unknowing&mdash;would be a strange thing, was the
thought in the mind of each as they walked through the
streets together, the next evening. The flare of an occasional
street-lamp falling on Latimer&#8217;s face revealed all its
story to his companion, though it might not have so revealed
itself to another. Baird himself was wondering how they
should each bear themselves throughout the meeting. She
would be so wholly unconscious&mdash;this girl who had always
been happy and knew nothing of the past. To her they
would be but a middle-aged popular lecturer and his unattractive-looking
friend&mdash;while each to himself was a man
concealing from her a secret. They must eliminate it from
their looks, their voices, their air. They must be frank
and courteous and conventional. Baird turned it all over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
in his mind. When they reached the house the second-story
windows were lighted as if to welcome them. Matt opened
the door for them, attired in his best and bowing low. To
receive such guests he felt to be an important social event,
which seemed to increase the chances of the claim and point
to a future when distinguished visitors would throng to a
much more imposing front door. He announced, with an
air of state, that his master and young mistress were &#8220;receivin&#8217;,&#8221;
and took ceremonious charge of the callers. He
had brushed his threadbare coat and polished each brass
button singly until it shone. An African imagination aided
him to feel the dignity of hospitality.
</p>
<p>The sound of a girl&#8217;s voice reached them as they went
upstairs. They glanced at each other involuntarily, and
Latimer&#8217;s breath was sharply drawn. It was not the best
preparation for calmness.
</p>
<p>A glowing small fire was burning in the stove, and, plain
and bare as the room was, it was filled with the effect of
brightness. Two beautiful young people were laughing
together over a book, and both rose and turned eager faces
towards the door. Big Tom rose, too, and, advancing to
meet the visitors, brought the girl with him.
</p>
<p>She was built on long and supple lines, and had happy
eyes and lovely bloom. The happy eyes were Margery&#8217;s,
though they were brown instead of harebell blue, and looked
out from a face which was not quite Margery&#8217;s, though its
smile was hers. Latimer asked himself if it was possible
that his manner wore the aspect of ordinary calm as he stood
before her.
</p>
<p>Sheba wondered at the coldness of his hand as she took it.
She was not attracted by his anxious face, and it must be
confessed that his personality produced on her the effect
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
it frequently produced on those meeting him for the first
time. It was not he who was the great man, but she felt
timid before him when he spoke to her.
</p>
<p>No one was shy of Baird. He produced his inevitable
effect also. In a few minutes he had become the centre
of the small company. He had made friends with Rupert,
and launched Tom in conversation. Sheba was listening
to him with a brightness of look charming to behold.
</p>
<p>They sat about the table and talked, and he led them
all back to the mountains which had been seeming so far
away. He wanted to hear of the atmosphere, the life, the
people; and yet, as they answered his queries and related
anecdotes, he was learning from each one something bearing
on the story of the claim. When Tom spoke of Barnesville
and Judge Rutherford, or Rupert of Delisleville and Matt,
their conversation was guided in such manner that business
details of the claim were part of what was said. It was
Tom who realised this first and spoke of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are talking of our own business as if it was the
one subject on earth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the worst of people
with a claim. I&#8217;ve seen a good many of them since I&#8217;ve
been in Washington&mdash;and we are all alike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been asking questions because the subject interests
me, too,&#8221; said Baird. &#8220;More people than yourselves
discuss it. It formed a chief topic of conversation when
I dined with Senator Milner, two nights ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Milner!&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;He was the man who had not
time to hear me in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His daughter, Mrs. Meredith, was inquiring about you.
She wanted to hear the story. I shall tell it to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed Tom; &#8220;if <i>you</i> tell it, it will have
a chance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; Baird laughed. &#8220;I may be able to help you.
A man who is used to audiences might be of some practical
value.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He met Sheba&#8217;s eyes by accident. A warm light leaped
into them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They care a great deal more than they will admit to
me,&#8221; she said to him, when chance left them together a few
minutes later, as Tom and Rupert were showing Latimer
some books. &#8220;They are afraid of making me unhappy by
letting me know how serious it will be if everything is lost.
They care too much for me&mdash;but I care for them, and if
I could do anything&mdash;or go to anyone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked into her eyes through a curious moment of
silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not all jest,&#8221; he said after it, &#8220;what I said just
now. I am a man who has words, and words sometimes are
of use. I am going to give you my words&mdash;for what they
are worth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall feel very rich,&#8221; she answered, and her simple
directness might have been addressed to a friend of years&#8217;
standing. It was a great charm, this sweet acceptance of
any kindness. &#8220;But I thought you were going away in
a few days?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But I shall come back, and I shall try to set
the ball rolling before I go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She glanced at Latimer across the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Latimer&mdash;&#8221; she hesitated; &#8220;do you think he does
not mind that&mdash;that the claim means so much for us? I
was afraid. He looked at me so seriously&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He looked at you a great deal,&#8221; interposed Baird,
quickly. &#8220;He could not help it. I am glad to have this
opportunity to tell you&mdash;something. You are very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
like&mdash;<i>very</i> like&mdash;someone he loved deeply&mdash;someone who died
years ago. You must forgive him. It was almost a shock to
him to come face to face with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; softly. &#8220;Someone who died years ago!&#8221; She
lifted Margery&#8217;s eyes and let them rest upon Baird&#8217;s face.
&#8220;It must be very strange&mdash;it must be almost awful&mdash;to find
yourself near a person very like someone you have loved&mdash;who
died years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Yes&mdash;awful. That is the word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the two men walked home together through the
streets, the same thought was expressed again, and it was
Latimer who expressed it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And when she looked at me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I almost cried
out to her, &#8216;Margery, Margery!&#8217; The cry leaped up from
the depths of me. I don&#8217;t know how I stopped it. Margery
was smaller and more childlike&mdash;her eyes are darker, her
face is her own, not Margery&#8217;s&mdash;but she looks at one as
Margery did. It is the simple clearness of her look, the
sweet belief, which does not know life holds a creature who
could betray it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; broke from Baird. The exclamation seemed
involuntary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet there was one who could betray it,&#8221; Latimer said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>cannot</i> forget,&#8221; said Baird. &#8220;No wonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The passing of years,&#8221; he said, &#8220;almost inevitably wipes
out or dims all things; but sometimes&mdash;not often, thank
Fate&mdash;there comes a phase of suffering in some man or
woman&#8217;s life which will not go. I once knew a woman&mdash;she
was the kind of woman people envy, and whose life
seems brilliant and full; it was full of the things most
people want, but the things she wanted were not for her,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
and there was a black wound in her soul. She had had
a child who had come near to healing her, and suddenly
he was torn out of her being by death. She said afterwards
that she knew she had been mad for months after
it happened, though no one suspected her. In the years
that followed she dared not allow herself to speak or think
of that time of death. &#8216;I must not let myself&mdash;I must not.&#8217;
She said this to me, and shuddered, clenching her hands
when she spoke. &#8216;Never, never, never, will it be better.
If a thousand years had passed it would always be the same.
One thought or word of it drags me back&mdash;and plunges
me deep into the old, awful woe. Old&mdash;it is not old&mdash;it
never can be old. It is as if it had happened yesterday&mdash;as
if it were happening to-day.&#8217; I know this is not often
so. But it is so with me when a thing drags Margery back
to me&mdash;drags me back to Margery. To-night, Baird; think
what it is to-night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He put a shaking hand on Baird&#8217;s hand, hurrying him
by the unconscious rapidity of his own pace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think what it is to-night,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;She seems
part of my being. I cannot free myself. I can see her
as she was when she last looked at me, as her child looked
at me to-night&mdash;with joyful bright eyes and lips. It was
one day when I went to see her at Boston. She was doing
a little picture, and it had been praised at the studio. She
was so happy&mdash;so happy. That was the last time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t,&#8221; cried Baird; &#8220;you must not call it back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not calling it back. It comes, it comes! You must
let me go on. You can&#8217;t stop me. That was the last time.
The next time I saw her she had changed. I scarcely knew
how&mdash;it was so little. The brightness was blurred. Then&mdash;then
comes all the rest. Her growing illness&mdash;the anxiousness&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
long days&mdash;the girl at the mills&mdash;the talk
of those women&mdash;the first ghastly, damnable fear&mdash;the
nights&mdash;the lying awake!&#8221; His breath came short and fast.
He could not stop himself, it was plain. His words tumbled
over each other as if he were a man telling a story in delirium.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can see her&mdash;as I went into
her room. I can see her shaking hands and lips and childish,
terrified eyes. I can feel her convulsive little fingers clutching
my feet, and her face&mdash;her face&mdash;lying upon them when
she fell down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot bear it,&#8221; cried Baird; &#8220;I cannot bear it.&#8221; He
had uttered the same cry once before. He had received
the same answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She bore it,&#8221; said Latimer, fiercely. &#8220;That last night&mdash;in
the cabin on the hillside&mdash;her cries&mdash;they were not
human&mdash;no, they did not sound human&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was checked. It was Baird&#8217;s hand which clutched
his arm now&mdash;it seemed as if for support. The man was
swaying a little, and in the light of a street-lamp near them
he looked up in a ghastly appeal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Latimer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go on; you see I can&#8217;t bear
it. I am not so strong as I was&mdash;before I began this work.
I have lost my nerve. You bring it before me as it is
brought before yourself. I am living the thing. I can&#8217;t
bear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer came back from the past. He made an effort
to understand and control himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, quite dull; &#8220;that was what the woman
I spoke of told me&mdash;that she lived the thing again. It is
not sane to let one&#8217;s self go back. I beg your pardon, Baird.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a curious job, that De Willoughby claim,&#8221; was said
in a committee-room of the House, one day. &#8220;It&#8217;s beginning
to attract attention because it has such an innocent air.
The sharp ones say that may be the worst feature of it,
because ingenuousness is more dangerous than anything
else if a job is thoroughly rotten. The claimants are the
most straightforward pair the place has ever seen&mdash;a big,
humourous, well-mannered country man, and a boy of
twenty-three. Rutherford, of Hamlin County, who is a
monument of simplicity in himself, is heart and soul in the
thing&mdash;and Farquhar feels convinced by it. Farquhar is
one of the men who are not mixed up with jobs. Milner
himself is beginning to give the matter a glance now and
then, though he has not committed himself; and now the
Reverend John Baird, the hero of the platform, is taking
it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird had proved his incidental offer of aid to have been
by no means an idle one. He had been obliged to absent
himself from Washington for a period, but he had returned
when his lecture tour had ended, and had shown himself
able in a new way. He was the kind of man whose conversation
people wish to hear. He chose the right people
and talked to them about the De Willoughby claim. He
was interesting and picturesque in connection with it, and
lent the topic attractions. Tom had been shrewdly right
in saying that his talk of it would give it a chance.
</p>
<p>He went often to the house near the Circle. Latimer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
did not go with him, and had himself explained his reasons
to big Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is better that I should
not see her often. She is too much like her mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Baird seemed to become by degrees one of the household.
Gradually&mdash;and it did not take long&mdash;Tom and he
were familiar friends. They had long talks together, they
walked side by side through the streets, they went in company
to see the men it was necessary to hold interviews
with. Their acquaintance became an intimacy which established
itself with curious naturalness. It was as if they had
been men of the same blood, who, having spent their lives
apart, on meeting, found pleasure in the discovery of their
relationship. The truth was that for the first time in his
life big Tom enjoyed a friendship with a man who was
educated and, in a measure, of the world into which he
himself had been born. Baird&#8217;s world had been that of New
England, his own, the world of the South; but they could
comprehend each other&#8217;s parallels and precedents, and argue
from somewhat similar planes. In the Delisleville days Tom
had formed no intimacies, and had been a sort of Colossus
set apart; in the mountains of North Carolina he had consorted
with the primitive and uneducated in good-humoured,
even grateful, friendliness; but he had mentally lived like
a hermit. To have talked to Jabe Doty or Nath Hayes
on any other subjects than those of crops and mountain
politics or sermons would have been to bewilder them hopelessly.
To find himself in mental contact with a man who
had lived and thought through all the years during which
he himself had vegetated at the Cross-roads, was a wonderful
thing to him. He realised that he had long ago given up
expecting anything approaching such companionship, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
that to indulge in it was to live in a new world. Baird&#8217;s
voice, his choice of words, his readiness and tact, the very
carriage of his fine, silvering head, produced on him the
effect of belonging to a new species of human being.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are all the things I have been missing for half
a lifetime,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what it was I was
making up my mind to going without&mdash;but it was such
men as you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On his own part, Baird felt he had made a rich discovery
also. The large humour and sweetness, the straightforward
unworldliness which was still level-headed and observing,
the broad kindliness and belief in humanity which were
so far from unintelligent or injudicious, were more attractive
to him than any collected characteristics he had met
before. They seemed to meet some strained needs in him.
To leave his own rooms, and find his way to the house whose
atmosphere was of such curious, homely brightness, to be
greeted by Sheba&#8217;s welcoming eyes, to sit and chat with
Tom in the twilight or to saunter out with him with an
arm through his, were things he soon began to look forward
to. He began also to realise that this life of home and the
affections was a thing he had lived without. During his
brief and wholly unemotional married life he had known
nothing like it. His years of widowerhood had been presided
over by Mrs. Stornaway, who had assumed the supervision
of his child as a duty. Annie had been a properly behaved,
rather uninteresting and unresponsive little person. She
had neat features and a realisation of the importance of respectability
and the proprieties which was a credit to Willowfield
and her training. She was never gay or inconsequent
or young. She had gone to school, she had had her
frocks lengthened and been introduced at tea-parties, exactly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
as had been planned for her. She never committed
a breach of discretion and she never formed in any degree
an element of special interest. She greatly respected her
father&#8217;s position as a successful man, and left it to be
vaguely due to the approbation of Willowfield.
</p>
<p>Big Tom De Willoughby, in two wooden rooms behind
a cross-roads store, in a small frame house kept in order
by a negro woman, and in the genteel poverty of Miss Burford&#8217;s
second floor, had surrounded himself with the comforts
and pleasures of the affections. It was not possible
to enter the place without feeling their warmth, and Baird
found himself nourished by it. He saw that Rupert, too,
was nourished by it. His young good looks and manhood
were developing under its influence day by day. He seemed
to grow taller and stronger. Baird had made friends with
him, too, and was with them the night he came in to announce
that at last he had got work to do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is to sell things from behind a counter,&#8221; he said,
and he went to Sheba and lifted her hand to his lips, kissing
it before them all. &#8220;We know a better man who has done
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know a bigger man who has done it,&#8221; said Tom.
&#8220;He did it because he was cut out for a failure. You are
doing it because you are cut out for a success. It will be
a good story for the reporters when the claim goes through,
my boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird perceived at once that it was a good story, even
at this particular period&mdash;a story which might be likely to
arouse curiosity and interest at a time when the awakening
of such emotions was of the greatest value. He told it at
the house of a magnate of the Supreme Court, the next
night. He had a varied and useful audience of important
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
politicians and their wives and daughters, the latter specially
fitted to act as mediums of transmission to other audiences.
He told the anecdote well. It was a good picture,
that of the room on Miss Burford&#8217;s upper floor, the large
claimant smiling like a benign Jove, and the handsome
youngster bending his head to kiss the girlish hand as if
he were doing homage to a queen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think his feeling was that his failure to get a better
thing was a kind of indignity done her,&#8221; Baird explained.
&#8220;He comes of a race of men who have worshipped women
and beauty in a romantic, troubadour fashion; only the
higher professions, and those treated in a patrician, amateur
style, were possible to them as work. And yet, as he said,
a better man than himself had done this same thing. What
moves one is that he has gone out to find work as if he had
been born a bricklayer. He tells me they are reaching the
end of all they depend on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what it is,&#8221; said Senator Milner to his daughter,
a few days afterwards; &#8220;this is going to be a feminine
claim. There was a time when I swore I wouldn&#8217;t touch it,
but I foresee what is going to happen. I&#8217;m going to give
in, and the other opposers are going to give in, and in the
end the Government will give in. And it will be principally
because a force of wives and daughters has marshalled itself
to march to the rescue. No one ever realises what a power
the American woman is, and how much she is equal to accomplishing.
If she took as much interest in politics as
English women do, she would elect every president and
control every party. We are a good-natured lot, and we
are fond of our womenkind and believe in them much more
than other nations do. They&#8217;re pretty clever and straight,
you know, as well as being attractive, and we can&#8217;t help
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
realising that they are often worth listening to. So we
listen, and when they drive a truth home we are willing
to believe in it. If the feminine halves of the two Houses
decide that the De Willoughby claim is all right, they&#8217;ll
prove it to us, and there you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we can prove it to you,&#8221; answered Mrs. Meredith.
&#8220;I went to see the people, and you could prove
anything straightforward by merely showing them to the
Houses in session. They could not conceal a disingenuous
thought among them&mdash;the delightful giant, the boy with
the eyelashes, the radiant girl, and the old black man put
together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the meantime Judge Rutherford did his honest best.
He had been too sanguine not to do it with some ruefulness
after the first few months. During the passage of these few
months many of his ingenuous ideals had been overthrown.
It had been borne in upon him that honest virtue was not
so powerful a factor as he had believed. The obstacles continually
arising in his pathway were not such as honest
virtue could remove. The facts that the claim was &#8220;as
straight as a string,&#8221; and that big Tom De Willoughby was
the best fellow in Hamlin were bewilderingly ineffective.
When prospects seemed to shine they might be suddenly
overshadowed by the fact that a man whose influence was
needed, required it to use for himself in other quarters;
when all promised well some apparently unexplainable
obstacle brought things to a standstill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you see it and now you don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Tom, resignedly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the position. This sort of thing might
go on for twenty years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was not aware that he spoke prophetically; yet claims
resting on as solid a basis as his own passed through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
same dragging processes for thirty years before they were
finally settled. But such did not possess the elements of
unprofessional picturesqueness this particular one presented
told to its upholders and opposers.
</p>
<p>Uncle Matt himself was to be counted among these elements.
He had made himself as familiar and popular a
figure in the public places of the Capital as he had been
in Delisleville. He made friends in the market-house and
on the steps of the Capitol and the Treasury and the Pension
Office; he hung about official buildings and obtained odd
jobs of work, his grey wool, his polished air of respectfulness,
his readiness and amiability attracted attention and pleased
those who came in contact with him. People talked to him
and asked him friendly questions, and when they did so
the reason for his presence in Washington and the importance
of the matter which had brought his young master
to the seat of government were fully explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I belongs to de gen&#8217;elmen dat&#8217;s here tendin&#8217; to de De
Willoughby claim, sah,&#8221; he would say. &#8220;Co&#8217;se, sah, you&#8217;ve
heern &#8217;bout it up to de Capitol. I&#8217;se yere waitin&#8217; on Marse
Rupert De Willoughby, but co&#8217;se he don&#8217; live yere&mdash;till
ye gets his claim through&mdash;like he do in de ole family
mansh&#8217;n at Delisleville&mdash;an&#8217; my time hangs heavy on my
han&#8217;s, cos I got so much ledger&mdash;so I comes out like dish
yer&mdash;an&#8217; takes a odd job now an&#8217; agen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not long before he was known as the De Willoughby
claimant, and loiterers were fond of drawing him
out on the subject of the &#8220;gol&#8217; mines.&#8221; He gathered a
large amount of information on the subjects of claims and
the rapid methods of working them. He used to come to
Tom sometimes, hot and excited with his struggles to comprehend
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
detail. &#8220;What all dish yer &#8217;bout Marse Rupert&#8217;s
granpa&#8216;n&#8217; bein&#8217; destructively disloyal? Dar warn&#8217;t no disloyal
&#8217;bout it. Ef dar was a fault to be foun&#8217; with the old
Judge it was dat he was mos&#8217; too loyal. He couldn&#8217; hol&#8217;
in, an&#8217; he qu&#8217;ol with mos&#8217; ev&#8217;y gen&#8217;elman he talk to. He
pass shots with one or two he had a disagreement with.
He pass shots with &#8217;em. How&#8217;s de Guv&#8217;ment gwine call
a gen&#8217;elman &#8216;destructively disloyal&#8217; when he ready any
minit to pass shots with his bes&#8217; fren&#8217;s, ef dey don&#8217; &#8217;gree
with his pol&#8217;tics&mdash;an&#8217; his pol&#8217;tics is on de side er Marse
Ab&#8217;am Lincoln an&#8217; de Yankees?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;constructively disloyal&#8221; rankled in his soul.
He argued about it upon every possible occasion, and felt
that if the accusation could be disproved the De Willoughby
case would be triumphantly concluded, which was in a large
measure true.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I steddies &#8217;bout dat thing day an&#8217; night,&#8221; he said to
Sheba. &#8220;Seems like dar oughter be someone to tes&#8217;ify. Ef
I had de money to travel back to Delisleville, I&#8217;d go an&#8217;
try to hunt someone up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was seated upon the steps of a Government building
one afternoon, discussing his favourite subject with some
of his coloured friends. He had been unusually eloquent,
and had worked himself up to a peroration, when he suddenly
ceased speaking and stared straight across the street
to the opposite side of the pavement, in such absorption that
he forgot to close his mouth.
</p>
<p>He was gazing at an elderly gentleman with a hook nose
and the dashing hat of the broad brim, which was regarded
as being almost as much an insignia of the South as the
bonnie blue flag itself.
</p>
<p>Uncle Matt got up and shuffled across the street. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
had become unconsciously apish with excitement. His old
black face worked and his hands twitched.
</p>
<p>He was so far out of breath when he reached the stranger&#8217;s
side that he could scarcely make himself heard, as, pulling
his hat off, he cried, agitatedly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctah! Doctah Atkinson, sah! Doctah Williams Atkinson!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger did not hear him distinctly, and waved him
off, evidently taking him for a beggar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve nothing for you, uncle,&#8221; he said, with condescending
good-nature.
</p>
<p>Uncle Matt found some of his breath, though not enough
to steady his voice. But his strenuousness was almost passionate.
&#8220;Doctah Williams Atkinson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
beggin&#8217;, Doctah Atkinson, sah; on&#8217;y axin&#8217; if I might speak
a few words to you, sah!&#8221; His shrewd insistance on the
name was effective.
</p>
<p>The elderly gentleman turned and looked at him in surprised
questioning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know me?&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is the first
time I have been in Washington&mdash;and I&#8217;ve not been here
an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed you, Doctah Atkinson, sah, in Delisleville,
Delisle County. Ev&#8217;ybody knowed you, Doctah! I was
dar endurin&#8217; er de war. I was dar de time you&mdash;you an&#8217;
Judge De Willoughby passed shots &#8217;bout dat Confed&#8217;ate
flag.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; said Dr. Atkinson, somewhat unsmilingly.
These were days when stories of the Confederate
flag were generally avoided. Northerners called it the rebel
flag.
</p>
<p>Matt had had the discretion to avoid this mistake. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
was wild with anxious excitement. Suddenly here had appeared
a man who could give all the evidence desired, if he
would do so. He had left Delisleville immediately on the
close of the war and had not been heard of. He might, like
so many, be passing on to some unknown point, and remain
in the city only between trains. There was no time to find
any better qualified person than himself to attend to this
matter. It must be attended to upon the spot and at this
moment. Uncle Matt knew all the incongruities of the
situation. No one could have known them better. But
a sort of hysteric courage grew out of his desperation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctah Williams Atkinson, sah!&#8221; he said. &#8220;May I
take de liberty of walking jes&#8217; behin&#8217; you an&#8217; axin&#8217; you a
question. I mustn&#8217;t keep you standin&#8217;. I beg you to &#8217;scuse
me, sah. I kin talk an&#8217; walk at de same time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dr. Williams Atkinson was an amenable person, and
Matt&#8217;s imploring old darky countenance was not without its
pathos. He was so evidently racked by his emotions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it all about?&#8221; he enquired.
</p>
<p>Matt stood uncovered and spoke fast. The hand holding
his hat was shaking, as also was his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m nothin&#8217; but a ole niggah man, Doctah Atkinson,
sah,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t for myself I&#8217;se intrudin&#8217; on ye;
it&#8217;s cos dar wasn&#8217;t time to go fer Marse De Willoughby
that could talk it like it oughter be. I jes&#8217; had to push
my ole niggah self in, fear you&#8217;d be gone an&#8217; we&#8217;d nevah
set eyes on you agin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Walk along by me,&#8221; said the Doctor. &#8220;What about the
De Willoughbys; I thought they were all dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All but Marse Thomas and Marse Rupert. Dey&#8217;s yere
&#8217;tendin&#8217; to de claim. Has you done heern &#8217;bout de claim,
Doctah Atkinson?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the Doctor answered. &#8220;I have been in too far
out West.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whereupon Matt plunged into the story of the &#8220;gol&#8217;
mines,&#8221; and the difficulties which had presented themselves
in the pathway of the claimant, and the necessity for the
production of testimony which would disprove the charge
of disloyalty. The detail was not very clear, but it had the
effect of carrying Dr. Williams Atkinson back to certain
good old days in Delisleville, before his beloved South had
been laid low and he had been driven far afield to live
among strangers, an alien. For that reason he found himself
moved by the recital and listened to it to its end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what has this to do with me?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;What
do you want of me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I seed you, sah,&#8221; Uncle Matt explained, &#8220;it all
come back to me in a minnit, how you an&#8217; de Judge pass
shots &#8217;bout dat flag; how you axed him to a dinner-party,
an&#8217; dar was a Confed&#8217;ate officer dar&mdash;an&#8217; a Confed&#8217;ate flag
hung up over de table, an&#8217; de Judge when he seed it he
&#8217;fused p&#8217;int blank to set down to de table, an&#8217; it ended
in you goin&#8217; out in de gyardin&#8217; an&#8217; changin&#8217; shots.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, damn it all,&#8221; cried Dr. Atkinson, but melted the
next moment. &#8220;The poor old fellow is dead,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217;
he died in disgrace and without friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Uncle Matt protested, eagerly; &#8220;without a single
friend, an&#8217; all &#8217;lone &#8217;ceptin&#8217; of Marse Rupert&mdash;all &#8217;lone.
An&#8217; it was &#8217;cos he was so strong for de Union&mdash;an&#8217; now
de Guv&#8217;ment won&#8217;t let his fambly have his money &#8217;cos dey&#8217;s
tryin&#8217; to prove him destructively disloyal&mdash;when he changed
shots with his bes&#8217; friend &#8217;cos he wouldn&#8217;t set under de
Confed&#8217;ate flag.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A grim smile wakened in Dr. Atkinson&#8217;s face.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; he said; &#8220;do you want me to explain to the
Government that the old scamp would have blown my brains
out if he could?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctah Atkinson, sah,&#8221; said Uncle Matt, with shrewd
gravity, &#8220;things is diff&#8217;rent dese days, an&#8217; de Guv&#8217;ment don&#8217;t
call dem gen&#8217;elmen scamps as was called dat in de Souf.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked up under the broad brim of his companion&#8217;s
hat with impassioned appealing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I jes&#8217; &#8217;member one thing, sah,&#8221; he said; &#8220;dat you was
a Southern gen&#8217;elman, and when a enemy&#8217;s dead a Southern
gen&#8217;elman don&#8217;t cherish no harm agin him, an&#8217; you straight
from Delisleville, an&#8217; you deed an&#8217; heerd it all, an&#8217; de Guv&#8217;ment
ken see plain enough you&#8217;s no carpet-bag jobber, an&#8217;
ef a gen&#8217;elman like you tes&#8217;ify, an&#8217; say you was enemies&mdash;an&#8217;
you did pass shots count er dat flag, how&#8217;s dey gwine
talk any more about dis destructive disloyal business? How
dey gwine ter do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am to be the means of enriching his family&mdash;the
family of an obstinate old fool, who abused me like
a pickpocket and spoiled a dress-coat for me when dress-coats
were scarce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead, Doctah Williams Atkinson, sah, he&#8217;s dead,&#8221;
said Matt. &#8220;It was mighty lonesome the way he died, too,
in dat big house, dat was stripped by de soldiers, an&#8217; ev&#8217;ybody
dead belonging to him&mdash;Miss De Willoughby, an&#8217; de
young ladies, an&#8217; Marse Romaine, an&#8217; Marse De Courcy&mdash;no
one lef but dat boy. It was mighty lonesome, sah.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Dr. Atkinson, reflectively. After
a few moments&#8217; silence, he added, &#8220;Whom do you want
me to tell this to? It may be very little use, but it may
serve as evidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Uncle Matt stopped upon the pavement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Would you let me &#8217;scort you to Senator Milner, sah?&#8221;
he said, in absolute terror at his own daring. &#8220;Would you
&#8217;low me to &#8217;tend you to Senator Grove? I knows what a
favior I&#8217;se axin&#8217;. I knows it doun to de groun&#8217;. I scarcely
dars&#8217;t to ax it, but if I loses you, sah, Marse Thomas De
Willoughby an&#8217; Marse Rupert may lose de claim. Ef I lose
you, sah, seems mos&#8217; like I gwine to lose my mind.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>There were a thousand chances to one that Senator Milner
might not be where Uncle Matt hoped to find him;
there were ten thousand chances to one that he might be
absorbingly engaged; there were uncountable chances
against them obtaining an interview with either man, and
yet it so happened they had the curious good luck to come
upon Senator Milner absolutely without searching for him.
It was rather he who came upon them at one of the entrances
of the Capitol itself, before which stood his daughter&#8217;s carriage.
Mrs. Meredith had spent the morning in the Senate,
being interested in the subject under debate. She was going
to take her father home to lunch, and as she was about to
enter her carriage her glance fell upon the approaching figures
of Uncle Matt and his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there is the faithful retainer of
the De Willoughby claimants, and there is not a shadow of
a doubt that he is in search of you. I am convinced that
he wishes to present that tall Southerner under the big hat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a moment&#8217;s space Uncle Matt was before them. The
deprecatory respect implied by his genuflections could
scarcely be computed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Senator Milner, sah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Doctah Williams Atkinson
of Delisleville has had de kindness to say he do me
de favior to come yeah, sah, to tes&#8217;ify, sah&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span></p>
<p>The large hat was removed by its owner with a fine sweep.
&#8220;The old fellow thinks I can do his people a service, Senator,&#8221;
explained Dr. Atkinson. &#8220;He is the servant of the
De Willoughby claimants, and it seems there has been some
question of Judge De Willoughby&#8217;s loyalty. During the
war, sir, he was called disloyal by his neighbours, and was
a much hated man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Uncle Matt&#8217;s lips were trembling. He broke forth, forgetting
the careful training of his youth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dar wasn&#8217;t a gen&#8217;elman in de county,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;dar
wasn&#8217;t a gen&#8217;elman in de State, mo&#8217; hated an&#8217; &#8217;spised an&#8217;
mo&#8217; looked down on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lean Southerner nodded acquiescently. &#8220;That&#8217;s
true,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite true. He was a copperhead and
a firebrand. We detested him. He insulted me at my own
table by refusing to sit down under the Southern flag, and
the matter ended with pistols.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is interesting, by Jove,&#8221; said the Senator, and he
looked from Uncle Matt to his capture. &#8220;I should like
to hear more of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you confer a pleasure on me by coming home to
lunch with us?&#8221; said Mrs. Meredith, who had begun to
look radiant. &#8220;I am interested in the De Willoughby claim;
I would give a great deal to see my father entirely convinced.
He has been on the verge of conviction for some
time. I want him to hear the story with all the details.
I beg you will let us take you home with us, Dr. Atkinson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; replied Dr. Williams Atkinson, with an
eighteenth century obeisance, &#8220;Judge De Willoughby and
I lived in open feud, but I am becoming interested in the
De Willoughby claim also. I accept your invitation with
pleasure.&#8221; And they drove away together.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;There is a man who seems to have begun to haunt
my pathway,&#8221; Baird said to Tom; &#8220;or perhaps it is Latimer&#8217;s
pathway, for it is when Latimer is with me that I
meet him. He is small and sharp-featured and unwholesome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds like Stamps,&#8221; laughed big Tom.
</p>
<p>He related the story of Stamps and his herds. The herds
had not gained the congressional ear as Mr. Stamps had
hoped. He had described their value and the gravity of
his loss to everyone who would listen to his eloquence, but
the result had been painfully discouraging. His boarding-house
had become a cheaper one week by week, and his blue
jeans had grown shabbier. He had fallen into the habit of
hanging about the entrances of public buildings and the
street corners in the hope of finding hearers and sympathisers.
His sharp little face had become haggard and more
weasel-like than before. Baird recognised big Tom&#8217;s description
of him at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it must be Stamps,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What is the meaning
of his interest in us? Does he think we can provide
evidence to prove the value of the herds? What are you
thinking of, De Willoughby?&#8221;
</p>
<p>In fact, there had suddenly recurred to Tom&#8217;s mind a
recollection of Sheba&#8217;s fifth birthday and the visit Mr.
Stamps had made him. With something of a shock he recalled
the shrewd meekness of his voice as he made his
exit.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It begins with a &#8216;L,&#8217; Tom; it begins with a &#8216;L.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The need of money was merely the natural expression
of Mr. Stamps&#8217;s nature. He had needed money when he was
born, and had laid infant schemes to secure cents from his
relatives and their neighbours before he was four years old.
But he had never needed it as he did now. The claim for
governmental restitution of the value of the daily increasing
herds had become the centre of his being. His belief in
their existence and destruction was in these days profound;
his belief that he should finally be remunerated in the name
and by the hand of national justice was the breath of life
to him. He had at last found a claim agent whose characteristics
were similar to his own, and, so long as he was able
to supply small sums with regularity, this gentleman was
willing to encourage him and direct him to fresh effort.
Mr. Abner Linthicum, of Vermont, had enjoyed several
successes in connection with two or three singular claims
which he had &#8220;put through&#8221; with the aid of genius combined
with a peculiar order of executive ability. They had
not been large claims, but he had &#8220;put them through&#8221;
when other agents had declined to touch them. In fact,
each one had been a claim which had been fought shy of,
and one whose final settlement had been commented upon
with open derision or raised eyebrows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours is the kind of claim I like to take up,&#8221; he had
said to his client in their first interview; &#8220;but it&#8217;s the
kind that&#8217;s got to be engineered carefully, and money is
needed to grease the wheels. But it&#8217;ll pay to grease them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It had needed money. Stamps had no large sums to give,
but he could be bled by drops. He had changed his cheap
boarding-place for a cheaper one, that he might be able to
save a few dollars a week; he had left the cheaper one for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
one cheaper still for the same reason, and had at last camped
in a bare room over a store, and lived on shreds of food costing
a few cents a day, that he might still grease the wheels.
Abner Linthicum was hard upon him, and was not in the
least touched by seeing his meagre little face grow sharper
and his garments hang looser upon his small frame.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll fat on the herds,&#8221; he would say, with practical
jocularity, and Mr. Stamps grinned feebly, his thin lips
stretching themselves over hungry teeth.
</p>
<p>The little man burned with the fever of his chase. He
sat in his bare room on the edge of his mattress&mdash;having
neither bedstead nor chairs nor tables&mdash;and his fingers
clutched each other as he worked out plans and invented
arguments likely to be convincing to an ungrateful Government.
He used to grow hot and cold over them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef Tom &#8217;d hev gone in with me an&#8217; helped me to work
out that thar thing about Sheby, we mought hev made
suthin&#8217; as would hev carried me through this,&#8221; he said to
himself more than once. He owed Tom a bitter grudge
in a mild way. His bitterness was the bitterness of a little
rat baulked of cheese.
</p>
<p>He had kept safely what he had found in the deserted
cabin, but, as the years passed, he lost something of the
hopes he had at first cherished. When he had seen Sheba
growing into a tall beauty he had calculated that her market
value was increasing. A handsome young woman who might
marry well, might be willing to pay something to keep a
secret quiet&mdash;if any practical person knew the secret and
it was unpleasant. Well-to-do husbands did not want to
hear their wives talked about. When Rupert De Willoughby
had arrived, Mr. Stamps had had a moment of discouragement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gwine to fall in love with her,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but he&#8217;d
oughter bin wealthier. Ef the De Willoughbys was what
they&#8217;d usedter be he&#8217;d be the very feller as &#8217;ud pay for
things to be kept quiet. The De Willoughbys was allers
proud an&#8217; &#8217;ristycratic, an&#8217; mighty high-falutin&#8217; &#8217;bout their
women folk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the subject of the De Willoughby claim was
broached he fell into feverish excitement. The De Willoughbys
had a chance in a hundred of becoming richer
than they had ever been. He took his treasure from its
hiding-place&mdash;sat turning it over, gnawing his finger-nails
and breathing fast. But treasure though he counted it, he
gained no clue from it but the one he had spoken of to
Tom when he had cast his farewell remark to him as he
closed the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef there&#8217;d hev been more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A name ain&#8217;t
much when there ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to tack on to it. It was
curi&#8217;s enough, but it&#8217;d hev to be follered up an&#8217; found out.
Ef he was only what he &#8217;lowed to be&mdash;&#8217;tain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to
hide that a man&#8217;s wife dies an&#8217; leaves a child. I don&#8217;t
b&#8217;lieve thar wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to hide&mdash;but it&#8217;d hev to be <i>proved</i>&mdash;an&#8217;
proved plain. It&#8217;s mighty aggravatin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One night, seeing a crowd pouring into a hall where a
lecture was to be delivered, he had lingered about the entrance
until the carriage containing the lecturer drove up.
Here was something to be had for nothing, at all events&mdash;he
could have a look at the man who was making such a name
for himself. There must be something in a man who could
demand so much a night for talking to people. He managed
to get a place well to the front of the loitering crowd on
the pavement.
</p>
<p>The carriage-door was opened and a man got out.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t him,&#8221; said a bystander. &#8220;That&#8217;s Latimer.
He&#8217;s always with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lecturer descended immediately after his companion,
but Stamps, who was pushing past a man who had got in
front of him, was displaying this eagerness, not that
he might see the hero of the hour, but that he might
look squarely at the friend who had slightly turned his
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh!&#8221; ejaculated the little hoosier, a minute later.
&#8220;I&#8217;d most swear to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was exasperatedly conscious that he could not quite
have sworn to him. The man he had seen nineteen years
before had been dressed in clumsily made homespun; he
had worn his black hair long and his beard had been unshaven.
Nineteen years were nineteen years, and the garb
and bearing of civilisation would make a baffling change in
any man previously seen attired in homespun, and carrying
himself as an unsociable hoosier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;d most sw&#8217;ar to him&mdash;most.&#8221; Stamps went
through the streets muttering, &#8220;I&#8217;d most <i>swar</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was but a few days later that Latimer saw him standing
on a street corner staring at him as he himself approached.
It was his curious intentness which attracted Latimer. He
did not recognise his face. He had not seen him more than
once in the days so long gone by, and had then cast a mere
abstracted glance at him. He did not know him again&mdash;though
his garments vaguely recalled months when he had
only seen men clothed in jeans of blue, or copperas brown.
He saw him again the next day, and again the next, and
after that he seemed to chance upon him so often that he
could not help observing and reflecting upon the eager scrutiny
in his wrinkled countenance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see that man?&#8221; he remarked to Baird. &#8220;I come
upon him everywhere. Do you know him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I thought it possible you did&mdash;or that he recognised
one of us&mdash;or wanted to ask some question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After his conversation with big Tom De Willoughby,
Latimer heard from Baird the story of the herds and their
indefatigable claimant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He comes from the Cross-roads?&#8221; said Latimer. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t remember his face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; said Baird, rather slowly, &#8220;that he
thinks he remembers yours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A week passed before Latimer encountered him again.
On this occasion he was alone. Baird had gone South to
Delisleville in the interests of the claim. He had unexpectedly
heard rumours of some valuable evidence which
might be gathered in a special quarter at this particular
moment, and had set out upon the journey at a few hours&#8217;
notice.
</p>
<p>Stamps had passed two days and nights in torment. He
had learned from Mr. Linthicum that his claim had reached
one of the critical points all claims must pass. More money
was needed to grease the wheels that they might carry it
past the crisis safely. Stamps had been starving himself for
days and had gone without fire for weeks, but the wheels
had refused to budge for the sum he managed to produce.
He was weak, and so feverish with anxiety and hunger
that his lips were cracked and his tongue dry to rasping.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all I kin scrape, Linthicum,&#8221; he said to that gentleman.
&#8220;I kin get a few dollars more if Minty kin sell her
crop o&#8217; corn an&#8217; send me the money&mdash;but this is every cent
I kin give ye now. Won&#8217;t it do <i>nothin</i>&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it won&#8217;t,&#8221; answered the claim agent, with a final
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
sort of shrug. &#8220;We&#8217;re dealing with a business that&#8217;s got
to be handled well or it&#8217;ll all end in smoke. <i>I</i> can&#8217;t work
on the driblets you&#8217;ve been bringing me&mdash;and, what&#8217;s more,
I should be a fool to try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But ye wouldn&#8217;t give it up!&#8221; cried Stamps, in a panic.
&#8220;Ye couldn&#8217;t throw me over, Linthicum!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no throwing over about it,&#8221; Linthicum said.
&#8220;I shall have to give the thing up if I can&#8217;t keep it going.
Money&#8217;s <i>got</i> to be used over a claim like this. I have had
to ask men for a thousand dollars at a time&mdash;and the thing
they were working was easier to be done than this is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A thousand dollars!&#8221; cried Stamps. He grew livid and
a lump worked in his throat, as if he was going to cry. &#8220;A
thousand dollars &#8217;ud buy me and sell me twice over, Mr.
Linthicum.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking you for a thousand dollars yet,&#8221; said
Linthicum. &#8220;I may have to ask you for five hundred before
long&mdash;but I&#8217;m not doing it now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred!&#8221; gasped Stamps, and he sat down in
a heap and dropped his damp forehead on his hands.
</p>
<p>That night, as Latimer entered the house of an acquaintance
with whom he was going to spend the evening, he
caught sight of the, by this time, familiar figure on the
opposite side of the street.
</p>
<p>The night was cold and damp, and rain was falling when
the door closed behind him. He heard it descending steadily
throughout the evening, and more than once the continuance
of the downpour was commented upon by some
member of the company. When the guests separated for
the night and Latimer turned into the street again, he had
scarcely walked five yards before hearing a cough; he cast
a glance over his shoulder and saw the small man in blue
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
jeans. The jeans were wet and water was dropping from
the brim of the old felt hat. The idea which at once possessed
his mind was that for some mysterious reason best
known to himself the wearer had been waiting for and was
following him. What was it for? He turned about suddenly
and faced the person who seemed so unduly interested
in his actions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to speak to me?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>This movement, being abrupt, rather upset Mr. Stamps&#8217;s
calculations. He came to a standstill, looking surprised
and nervous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar ain&#8217;t no harm done,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I aimed to find
out whar ye lived.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been waiting for me to come out of the
house?&#8221; asked Latimer, feeling some curiosity.
</p>
<p>Stamps admitted that he had, the admission being somewhat
reluctant, as if he felt it might commit him to something.
Having so far betrayed himself, however, he drew
something nearer, with a suggestion of stealthiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re mighty like a man I once knowed,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Yer powerful like him. I never seed two men more liker
each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did he live when you knew him?&#8221; Latimer enquired,
the wretched, dank little figure suddenly assuming
the haunting air of something his eye must have rested on
before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I seen him in North Ca&#8217;llina. He did not live thar&mdash;in
the way other folks did. He was jest stayin&#8217;. I won&#8217;t
keep ye standin&#8217; in the rain,&#8221; insinuatingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll jest walk
along by ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer walked on. This dragged him back again, as
other things had done once or twice. He did not speak, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
strode on almost too rapidly for Stamps&#8217;s short legs. The
short legs began to trot, and their owner to continue his
explanations rather breathlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He warn&#8217;t livin&#8217; thar same as other folks,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Thar was suthin&#8217; curi&#8217;s about him. Nobody knowed nothin&#8217;
about him, an&#8217; nobody knew nothin&#8217; about his wife.
Now I come to think of it, nobody ever knowed his name&mdash;but
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he tell it to you?&#8221; said Latimer, rigidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; with something verging on a chuckle, discreetly
strangled at its birth. &#8220;Neither him nor his wife was
tellin&#8217; things just then. They was layin&#8217; mighty low. She
died when her child was borned, an&#8217; he lit out right away
an&#8217; ain&#8217;t never been heern tell of since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer said nothing. The rain began to fall more heavily,
and Mr. Stamps trotted on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lowin&#8217; for store clothes an&#8217; agein&#8217;,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I
never seen two fellers favour each other as you two do. An&#8217;
his name bein&#8217; the same as yourn, makes it curi&#8217;ser still.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are getting very wet,&#8221; was Latimer&#8217;s sole comment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got wet to the skin long afore you come out that
house where ye was,&#8221; said Mr. Stamps; &#8220;but I &#8217;low to find
out whar ye live.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I live about a quarter of a mile from here,&#8221; said Latimer.
&#8220;The brick house with the bay windows, opposite the
square. Number 89.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather see ye in,&#8221; replied Stamps, cautiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I might go into a house I do not live in,&#8221; returned
Latimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye won&#8217;t. It&#8217;s too late. Ain&#8217;t ye gwine to say nothin&#8217;,
Mr. Latimer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want me to say?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sheby&#8217;s good-lookin&#8217; gal,&#8221; Stamps said. &#8220;Tom&#8217;s done
well by her. Ef they get their claim through they&#8217;ll be
powerful rich. Young D&#8217;Willerby he&#8217;s mightily in love
with her&mdash;an&#8217; he wouldn&#8217;t want no talk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the house I live in at present,&#8221; said Latimer,
pointing with his umbrella. &#8220;We shall be there directly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ministers don&#8217;t want no talk neither,&#8221; proceeded
Stamps. &#8220;Ef a minister had made a slip an&#8217; tried hard
to hide it an&#8217; then hed it proved on him he wouldn&#8217;t like
it&mdash;an&#8217; his church members wouldn&#8217;t like it&mdash;an&#8217; his high
class friends. There&#8217;d be a heap er trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Number 89,&#8221; said Latimer. &#8220;You see I was speaking
the truth. This is the gate; I am going in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His tone and method were so unsatisfactory and unmoved
that&mdash;remembering Abner Linthicum&mdash;Stamps became desperate.
He clutched Latimer&#8217;s arm and held it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be worth money fur him to git safe hold of them
letters. Thar was two on &#8217;em. I didn&#8217;t let on to Tom.
I wasn&#8217;t gwine to let on to him till I found out he&#8217;d go
in with me. Them as knowed the man they was writ by
&#8217;ud be able to see a heap in &#8217;em. They&#8217;d give him away.
Ye&#8217;d better get hold of &#8217;em. They&#8217;re worth five hundred.
They&#8217;re yourn&mdash;ye wrote &#8217;em yourself. Ye ain&#8217;t jest like
him&mdash;ye&#8217;re <i>him</i>&mdash;I&#8217;ll sw&#8217;ar to ye!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer suddenly saw his mother&#8217;s mild New England
countenance, with its faded blue eyes. He remembered the
hours he had spent telling her the details of the sunny days
in Italy, where Margery had lain smiling in the sunset. He
looked down the long wet street, the lamps gleaming on its
shining surface. He thought of Baird, who would not return
until the day on which he was to deliver a farewell
lecture before leaving Washington. He recalled his promptness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span>
of resource and readiness for action. If Baird were but
in the room above in which the light burned he would tell
him! His mind seemed to vault over all else at this instant&mdash;to
realise the thing which it had not reached at the first
shock. He turned on Stamps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say there were letters?&#8221; he exclaimed, forgetting
his previous unresponsiveness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two. Not long &#8217;uns, an&#8217; wrote keerful&mdash;without no
name. But they say a heap. They was wrote when he
had to leave her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer&#8217;s heart seemed physically to turn over in his side.
He had never known she had had a line of handwriting in
her possession. This must be some scrap of paper, some last,
last words she clung to with such anguish of desperation
that she could not tear herself from them, and so had died
leaving them in their secret hiding-place. The thought was
a shock. The effort it cost him to regain his self-control
was gigantic. But he recovered his outward calm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better go home and change your clothing,&#8221; he
said, as coldly as he had spoken before. &#8220;You are not
a young man or a strong one, and you may kill yourself.
You are making a mistake about me; but if you will give
me your address I will see you again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thort ye would&mdash;mebbe,&#8221; said Stamps. &#8220;I thort
mebbe ye would. They&#8217;re worth it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he scribbled a few words on a scrap of paper with
a stump of a pencil&mdash;producing both rapidly from his
pocket&mdash;and thrusting it into Latimer&#8217;s hand, trotted away
contentedly down the long wet street.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
</div>

<p>As he entered his rooms, Latimer glanced round at
Baird&#8217;s empty chair and wished he had found him sitting
in it. He walked over to it and sat down himself&mdash;simply
because it was Baird&#8217;s chair and suggested his presence.
Latimer knew how he would have turned to look at him
as he came in, and that he would at once have known by
instinct that the old abyss had been re-opened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he were here,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;he would tell me what
to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But he knew what he was going to do. He must buy
the little hoosier&#8217;s silence if it was to be bought. He should
see the letters. Through all those months she had hidden
them. He could imagine with what terror. She could not
bear to destroy them, and yet he knew there must have
been weeks she did not dare to go near their hiding-place.
They must have been concealed in some cranny of the cabin.
How she must have shuddered with dread when he had
accidentally approached the spot where they lay concealed.
He recalled now that several times he had been wakened
from his sleep in the middle of the night by hearing her
moving about her room and sobbing. She had perhaps
crept out of her bed in the darkness to find these scraps
of paper, to hold them in her hands, to crush them against
her heart, to cover them with piteous kisses, salt with scalding
tears.
</p>
<p>On one such night he had risen, and, going to the closed
door, had spoken to her through it, asking her if she was ill.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Lucien,&#8221; she had cried out, &#8220;but&mdash;but I am
so lonely&mdash;so lonely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had told him the next day that the sound of the wind
soughing in the pines had kept her from sleep, and she
had got up because she could not bear to be still and listen.
</p>
<p>He had known well what she meant by her desolate little
answer to him. She had been a beloved thing always. As
a child her playmates had loved her, as a school-girl she had
won the hearts of companions and teachers alike. Nature
had endowed her with the brightness and sweetness which
win affection. The smile in her eyes wakened an answer
even in the look of passing strangers. Suddenly all had
changed. She was hidden in the darkness, crushed and
shamed, an outcast and a pariah&mdash;a thing only to be kept
out of sight. Sometimes, after she had been sitting lost
in thought, Latimer had seen her look up bewildered, glance
at her little, deformed body, and sit white and trembling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is different,&#8221; she panted out once. &#8220;It is
as if all the world was black. It is&mdash;because&mdash;because I am
black!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer had made no effort to wring from her the name
she had prayed to be allowed to hide; yet he had often
wondered that in some hysteric moment it had not escaped
her&mdash;that mere helpless anguish did not betray her into
uttering some word or phrase which might have served as
a clue. But this she had never done, and between them
there had been built a stone wall of silence. Yet, in spite
of it, he had known that her young heart was broken with
love for this nameless traitor&mdash;a love which would not die.
He had seen it in the woe of her eyes, in the childlike
longing of her look when she sat and gazed out over the
wild beauty of the land, thinking she was unobserved. In
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span>
his own soul there had been black, bitter hate, but in hers
only loneliness and pain.
</p>
<p>There came back to him&mdash;and he sprang up and ground
his teeth, pacing the floor as he remembered it&mdash;a night
when she had wandered out alone in the starlight, and at
last he had followed her and found her&mdash;though she did not
know he was near&mdash;standing where the roof of pine-trees
made a darkness, and as he stood within four feet of her
he had heard her cry to the desolate stillness:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could see you once! If I could see you once&mdash;if
I could touch you&mdash;if I could hear you speak&mdash;just once&mdash;just
once!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And she had wailed it low&mdash;but as a starving child might
cry for bread. And he had turned and gone away, sick of
soul, leaving her.
</p>
<p>He had told this to Baird, and had seen the muscles of
his face twitch and his eyes suddenly fill with tears. He
had left his seat and crossed the room to conceal his emotion,
and Latimer had known that he did not speak because
he could not.
</p>
<p>The letters were written with caution, Stamps had said,
and the mention of names had been avoided in them; and,
though he ground his teeth again as he thought of this, he
realised that the knowledge brought by a name would be
of no value to him. Long ago he had said to big Tom in
the cabin on the hillside: &#8220;If ever we meet face to face
knowing each other, I swear I will not spare him.&#8221; Spare
him? Spare him what? What vengeance could he work
which would wipe out one hour of that past woe? None. He
had grown sick to death in dwelling with the memories he
could not bury. He had been born cursed by the temperament
which cannot outlive. There are such. And it was the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
temperament to which vengeance brings no relief. No; if
they two met face to face, what words could be said&mdash;what
deeds could be done? His forehead and hands grew damp
with cold sweat as he confronted the despair of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better that I should not know his name,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Better that we should never meet. Pray God that he is
dead; pray God the earth does not hold him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man who had followed him had plainly but one purpose,
which was the obtaining of money. He looked as if
he needed it directly. He would go to him and pay him
what he asked and get the papers. They must be in no
other hands than his own. When he had them, Baird and
himself would destroy them together, and that would be
the end.
</p>
<p>He encountered no difficulties when he went in search
of the address Stamps had given him. The room he had
directed him to was over a small store on the south side
of Pennsylvania Avenue. When he entered it he saw at
once that the man whose circumstances reduced him to
living in it must be one whose need of money was great
indeed. It was entirely unfurnished, except for a mattress
lying on the floor, and Stamps was stretched upon it, coughing
and feverish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I knowed ye&#8217;d be here purty soon.
Thar ain&#8217;t no chair to ax ye to set down in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not want to sit,&#8221; said Latimer. &#8220;You are ill.
You caught cold last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose I did, durn it,&#8221; answered Stamps. &#8220;I got
drenched to the skin, an&#8217; I hadn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; dry to put on
when I got home. But I&#8217;d seen ye&mdash;an&#8217; told ye what I&#8217;d
&#8217;lowed to tell ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the papers you spoke of?&#8221; Latimer asked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span></p>
<p>Stamps&#8217;s feverish lips stretched themselves in an agreeable
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t yere,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;an&#8217; they won&#8217;t be yere
till I&#8217;ve got the pay fur &#8217;em. Ef thar was names in &#8217;em
they&#8217;d cost ye a heap more than five hundred dollars&mdash;an&#8217;
they&#8217;d cost ye more anyhow ef I hadn&#8217;t a use for that five
hundred jest this particular time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; enquired Latimer. He meant to
waste no words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re in North Ca&#8217;lliny,&#8221; answered the little mountaineer,
cheerfully. &#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve got a woman thar es&#8217;ll send
&#8217;em when I want &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She may send them when you wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stamps fell into a paroxysm of coughing, clutching his
side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will ye give five hundred?&#8221; he panted when it was
over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye want &#8217;em pretty bad, do ye?&#8221; said Stamps, looking
at him with a curiosity not untinged with dubiousness. He
was sharp enough to realise that, upon the whole, his case
was not a strong one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want them for the reason you think I want them
for,&#8221; Latimer replied; his voice was cold and hard, and his
manner unpromisingly free from emotion or eagerness. &#8220;I
want them for a reason of my own. As for your pretence
of recognising me as a man you have seen before, go out
into the street corners and say what you choose. My friends
know how and where my life has been spent, and you are
shrewd enough to know how far your word will stand against
mine. If you need the money now, you had better produce
what you have to sell.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I could get ye mightily talked about,&#8221; said Stamps, restlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it,&#8221; answered Latimer, and turned as if to walk
out of the room. He knew what he was dealing with, and
saw the fevered cupidity and fear in the little, shifting eyes.
</p>
<p>Stamps struggled up into a sitting posture on his mattress
and broke forth into coughs again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back yere,&#8221; he cried between gasps; &#8220;ye needn&#8217;t
ter go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer paused where he stood and waited until the fit
of coughing was over; and Stamps threw himself back exhausted.
His shifty eyes burned uncannily, his physical
and mental fever were too much for him. Linthicum had
just left him before Latimer arrived, and upon the production
of five hundred dollars rested the fate of the claim for
the herds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef ye&#8217;ll bring the money&mdash;cash down&mdash;next Saturday,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll give ye the papers. I&#8217;ll hev &#8217;em yere by then.
When ye&#8217;ve got &#8217;em,&#8221; with the agreeable grin again, &#8220;ye
kin go to yer friend&#8217;s far&#8217;well lecture easy in ye mind. Ye
wouldn&#8217;t be likely to go to many of &#8217;em ef he knowed what
I could tell him. He&#8217;s powerful thick with Tom D&#8217;Willerby
and Sheby. They think a heap of him. Tom must hev
guessed what I&#8217;ve guessed, but he don&#8217;t want no talk on
accounts o&#8217; Sheby. Tom knows which side his bread&#8217;s buttered&mdash;he
ain&#8217;t nigh as big a fool as he looks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer stood still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next Saturday?&#8221; was his sole response. &#8220;In the
meantime, I should advise you to send for the doctor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He left him coughing and catching at his side.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
</div>

<p>During this week Judge Rutherford&#8217;s every hour was
filled with action and excitement. He had not a friend
or acquaintance in either House whom he did not seek out
and labour with. He was to be seen in the lobby, in the
corridors, in committee-rooms, arguing and explaining,
with sheafs of papers in his hands and bundles of documents
bulging out of his pockets. He walked down the avenue
holding the arm of his latest capture, his trustworthy countenance
heated by his interest and anxiety, his hat thrust
on the back of his head. &#8220;There&#8217;s got to be justice done,&#8221;
he would protest. &#8220;You see, justice has got to be done.
There&#8217;s no other way out of it. And I&#8217;d swear there ain&#8217;t
a man among you who doesn&#8217;t own up that it is justice, now
all this evidence has been brought together. The country
couldn&#8217;t be responsible for throwing the thing over&mdash;even
till another session. Everything&#8217;s in black and white and
sworn to and proved&mdash;and the papers Baird has sent in
clinch the whole thing. Now just look here&mdash;&#8221; And he
would repeat his story and refer to his documents, until
even the indifferent succumbed through exhaustion, if not
conviction.
</p>
<p>He appeared at Dupont Circle two or three times a day,
always fevered with delighted hope, always with some anecdote
to relate which prognosticated ultimate triumph. If
he could not find anyone else to talk to he seized upon Miss
Burford or Uncle Matt and poured forth his news to them.
He wrote exultant letters to Jenny, the contents of which,
being given to Barnesville, travelled at once to Talbot&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
Cross-roads and wakened it to exhilarated joyfulness, drawing
crowds to the Post-office and perceptibly increasing the
traffic on the roads from the mountains to that centre of
civilised social intercourse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom&#8217;s a-gwine to win his claim,&#8221; it was said. &#8220;Judge
Rutherford&#8217;s walkin&#8217; it right through for him. Tom&#8217;ll be
way ahead of the richest man in Hamlin. Sheby&#8217;ll be a
hairest. Lordy! what a sight it&#8217;ll be to see &#8217;em come back.
Wonder whar they&#8217;ll build!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In Washington it had begun to be admitted even by the
reluctant that the fortunes of the De Willoughby claim
seemed to have taken a turn. Members of substantial position
discussed it among themselves. It was a large claim,
and therefore a serious one, but it had finally presented
itself upon an apparently solid foundation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it is the member from the mountain districts, and
the old negro, and the popular minister who will have carried
it through if it passes,&#8221; said Senator Milner to his daughter.
&#8220;It is a monumental thing at this crisis of affairs&mdash;a huge,
unpopular claim on a resenting government carried through
by persons impelled solely by the most purely primitive and
disinterested of motives. An ingenuous county politician,
fresh from his native wilds, works for it through sheer prehistoric
affection and neighbourliness; an old black man&mdash;out
of a story-book&mdash;forges a powerful link of evidence
for mere faithful love&#8217;s sake; a man who is a minister of
the gospel, a gentleman and above reproach, gives to its
service all his interest, solely because he cherishes an affectionate
admiration for the claimants. Nobody has laboured
with any desire for return. Nobody has bargained for anything.
Nobody would accept anything if it was offered
to them. The whole affair has been Arcadian.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will it be decided for the De Willoughbys&mdash;will it?&#8221;
said Mrs. Meredith.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the Senator; &#8220;I think it will. And
I confess I shall not advance any objections.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Meeting big Tom on the avenue, Ezra Stamps stopped
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; he wheezed, hoarsely, &#8220;I heern tell you was
likely ter git yer claim through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are times when you can hear that about almost
any claim,&#8221; answered Tom. &#8220;What I&#8217;m waiting for is to
hear that I&#8217;ve got it through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stamps gnawed his finger-nails restlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re lucky,&#8221; he said; &#8220;ye allus was lucky.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the herds?&#8221; said Tom.
</p>
<p>Stamps gave him an agonised look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hev ye ever said anything agen me, Tom&mdash;to any man
with inflooence? Hev ye, now? &#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t be neighbourly
of ye if ye hed&mdash;an&#8217; we both come from the Cross-roads&mdash;an&#8217;
I allus give ye my custom. Ye won&#8217;t never go
agen me, will ye, Tom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been asked any questions about you,&#8221; Tom
said. &#8220;Look here, you had better go to some hospital and
ask to be taken in. What are you walking about the street
for in that fix? You can scarcely breathe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-gwine to walk about until Saturday,&#8221; answered
Stamps, with a grin. &#8220;I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; arter my own claim&mdash;an&#8217;
Abner Linthicum. Arter Saturday I&#8217;ll lie up for a
spell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better do it before Saturday,&#8221; Tom remarked
as he left him.
</p>
<p>Stamps stood and watched him walk away, and then
turned into a drug-store and bought a cheap bottle of cough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span>
mixture. He was passing through the early stages of pneumonia,
and was almost too weak to walk, but he had gone
from place to place that morning like a machine. Linthicum
had driven him. So long as he was employed in badgering
other men he was not hanging about the agent&#8217;s office.
Linthicum was not anxious that he should be seen there
too frequently. After the payment of the five hundred
dollars there would be no more to be wrung from him, and
he could be dropped. He could be told that it was useless
to push the claim further. Until the five hundred was
secured, however, he must be kept busy. Consequently,
he went from one man to the other until he could walk
no more. Then he crawled back to his room and sent a note
to Latimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cayn&#8217;t git the papers tel Saturday afternoon. Ef ye
bring the money about seven ye ken hev them. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t
no use comin&#8217; no earlier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer found the communication when he returned to
his rooms in the evening. He had been out on business
connected with Baird&#8217;s final lecture. It was to be a special
event, and was delivered in response to a general request.
A building of larger dimensions than the hall previously
used had been engaged. The demand for seats had been
continuously increasing. The newspaper and social discussion
of the prospects of the De Willoughby claim had added
to the interest in Baird. This brilliant and popular man,
this charming and gifted fellow, had felt such a generous
desire to assist the claimants that he had gone South in the
interest of their fortunes. He had been detained in Delisleville
and could barely return in time to appear before
his audience.
</p>
<p>The enthusiasm and eagerness were immense. Every
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
man who had not heard him felt he must hear him now;
everyone who had heard him was moved by the wish to
be of his audience again. Latimer had been besieged on
all sides, and, after a hard day, had come home fagged and
worn. But he was not worn only by business interviews,
newspaper people, and applicants for seats which could not
be obtained. He was worn by his thoughts of the past days,
by his lack of Baird&#8217;s presence and his desire for his return.
His influence was always a controlling and supporting one.
Latimer felt less morbid and more sane when they were
together.
</p>
<p>This same night Senator Milner and Judge Rutherford
called in company at the house near the Circle. When
Uncle Matt opened the door for them Judge Rutherford
seized his hand and shook it vigorously. The Judge was in
the mood to shake hands with everybody.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Matt,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to get it through,
and in a week&#8217;s time you&#8217;ll be a rich man&#8217;s servant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Matt fled back to Miss Burford trembling with joy and
excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do ye think we is gwine t&#8217;rough, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;D&#8217;ye think we is? Seems like we was the Isrilites a-crossin&#8217;
the Red Sea, an&#8217; the fust of us is jest steppin&#8217; on de sho&#8217;.
Lordy, Miss Burford, ma&#8217;am, I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;se gwine
to stan&#8217; dat great day when we <i>is</i> th&#8217;ough, shore enuff.
Wash&#8216;n&#8217;ton city ain&#8217;t gwine be big enuff to hol&#8217; me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a great day, Uncle Matthew,&#8221; replied Miss
Burford, with elated decorum of manner. &#8220;The De Willoughby
mansion restored to its former elegance. Mr.
Thomas De Willoughby the possessor of wealth, and the
two young people&mdash;&#8221; She bridled a little, gently, and
touched her eyes with her handkerchief with a slight cough.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When Marse De Courcy an&#8217; Miss Delia Vanuxem was
married, dar was people from fo&#8217; counties at de infar,&#8221; said
Matt. &#8220;De fust woman what I was married to, she done
de cookin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Senator Milner was shaking hands with big Tom upstairs.
He regarded him with interest, remembering the morning
he had evaded an interview with him. The little room
was interesting; the two beautiful young people suggested
the atmosphere of a fairy story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are on the verge of huge good fortune, I think,
Mr. De Willoughby,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I felt that I should like
to come with Rutherford to tell you that all is going very
well with your claim. Members favour it whose expression
of opinion is an enormous weight in the balance. Judge
Rutherford is going to speak for you&mdash;and so am I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Judge Rutherford shook Tom&#8217;s hand rather more vigorously
than he had shaken Matt&#8217;s. &#8220;I wish to the Lord
I was an orator, Tom,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I can&#8217;t make them
listen to me this time I believe I shall blow my brains out.
But, what with Williams, Atkinson, and Baird, we&#8217;ve got
things that are pretty convincing, and somehow I swear
the claim has begun to be popular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the two men had gone the little room was for a
few moments very still. Each person in it was under the
influence of curiously strong emotion. Anxious waiting
cannot find itself upon the brink of great fortune and remain
unmoved. Some papers with calculations worked out
in them lay upon the table, and big Tom sat looking at
them silently. Sheba stood a few feet away from him, her
cheeks flushed, light breaths coming quickly through her
parted lips. Rupert looked at her as youth and love must
look at love and youth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;are you thinking of
what we shall do if we find ourselves millionaires?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Tom.
</p>
<p>His eyes rested on the boy in thoughtful questioning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;ll own I&#8217;m not thinking of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither am I,&#8221; said Rupert. He drew nearer to Sheba.
&#8220;It would be a strange thing to waken and find ourselves
owners of a fortune,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We may waken to find it
so&mdash;in a few days. But there is always a chance that things
may fail one. I was thinking of what we should do if&mdash;we
lose everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheba put out her slim hand. She smiled with trembling
lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been across the mountain,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We
came together&mdash;and we will go back together. Will you
go back with us, Rupert?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took her in his strong young arms and kissed her,
while Tom looked on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I was thinking,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;that it does
not matter whether we win the claim or lose it. The house
is gone and the store is gone, but we can add a room to
the cabin in Blair&#8217;s Hollow&mdash;we can do it ourselves&mdash;and I
will learn to plough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He dropped on one knee like a young knight and kissed
her little, warm, soft palm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can take care of you and Uncle Tom, Sheba,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;will you marry me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will marry you,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;We three can
be happy together&mdash;and there will always be the spring
and the summer and the winter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May she marry me, Uncle Tom,&#8221; Rupert asked, &#8220;even
though we begin life like Adam and Eve?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She shall marry you the day we go back to the mountains,&#8221;
said Tom. &#8220;I always thought Adam and Eve would
have had a pretty fair show&mdash;if they had not left the Garden
of Eden behind them when they began the world for themselves.
You won&#8217;t have left it behind you. You&#8217;ll find it
in the immediate vicinity of Talbot&#8217;s Cross-roads.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p>The facts in detail which the Reverend John Baird had
journeyed to Delisle County in the hope of being able to
gather, he had been successful in gaining practical possession
of. Having personal charm, grace in stating a case,
and many resources both of ability and manner, he had
the power to attract even the prejudiced, and finally to win
their interest and sympathies. He had seen and conversed
with people who could have been reached in no ordinary
way, and having met them had been capable of managing
even their prejudices and bitterness of spirit. The result
had been the accumulation of useful and convincing evidence
in favour of the De Willoughbys, though he had in
more than one instance gained it from persons who had been
firm in their intention to give no evidence at all. This
evidence had been forwarded to Washington as it had been
collected, and when Baird returned to the Capital it was
with the knowledge that his efforts had more than probably
put the final touches to the work which would gain the
day for the claimants.
</p>
<p>His train was rather late, and as it drew up before the
platform he glanced at his watch in some anxiety. His
audience for the lecture must already have begun to turn
their faces toward the hall in which the evening&#8217;s entertainment
was to be held. He had hoped to reach his journey&#8217;s
end half an hour earlier. He had wanted a few minutes
with Latimer, whose presence near him had become
so much a part of his existence, that after an absence he felt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span>
he had lacked him. He took a carriage at the depot and
drove quickly to their rooms. They were to leave them in
a day or two and return to Willowfield. Already some of
their possessions had been packed up. The sitting-room
struck him as looking a little bare as he entered it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Latimer out,&#8221; he asked the mulatto who brought
up his valise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. He was called out by a message. He left a
note for you on the desk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird went to the desk and found it. It contained only
a few lines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is prepared for you. The audience will be
the best you have had at any time. I have been sent for by
the man Stamps. He is ill of pneumonia and wishes to deliver
some letters to me. I will be with you before you go
on the platform.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Since he had left Washington, Baird had heard from
Latimer but once and then but briefly. He had felt that
his dark mood was upon him, and this reference to letters
recalled the fact.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stamps is the little man with the cattle claim,&#8221; he commented
to himself. &#8220;He comes from the neighbourhood
of the Cross-roads. What letters could he have to hand
over?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he began to dress, wondering vaguely.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Stamps had spent a sleepless night. He could not sleep
because his last interview with Linthicum had driven him
hard, even though he had been able to promise him the
required five hundred dollars; he also could not sleep because
the air of the city had been full of talk about the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
promising outlook of the De Willoughby claim. Over the
reports he had heard, he had raged almost with tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Dwillerbys is ristycrats,&#8221; he had said. &#8220;They&#8217;re
ristycrats, an&#8217; it gives &#8217;em a pull even if they was rebels an&#8217;
Southerners. A pore man ez works hard an&#8217; ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
but a honest farmer, an&#8217; a sound Union man ain&#8217;t got no
show. Ef I&#8217;d been a ristycrat I could hev got inflooence ez
hed hev pulled wires fur me. But I hain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but my
loyal Union principles. I ain&#8217;t no ristycrat, an&#8217; I never
aimed to be none.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The bitterness of his nervous envy would have kept him
awake if he had had no other reason for being disturbed,
but most of all he was sleepless, because he was desperately
ill and in danger he knew nothing of. Cold and weeks of
semi-starvation, anxiety, excitement, and drenched garments
had done the little man to death, and he lay raging
with fever and stabbed with pain at each indrawn breath,
tossing and gasping and burning, but thinking only of
Linthicum and the herds and the scraps of paper which
were to bring him five hundred dollars. He was physically
wretched, but even while he was racked with agonised fits
of coughing and prostrated with pain it did not occur to
him to think that he was in danger. He was too wholly
absorbed in other thoughts. The only danger he recognised
was the danger that there might be some failure in
his plans&mdash;that Linthicum might give him up&mdash;that the
parson might back out of his bargain, realising that after
all letters unsigned save by a man&#8217;s Christian name were
not substantial evidence. Perhaps he would not come at
all; perhaps he would leave the city; perhaps if he came
he would refuse to give more than half or quarter the sum
asked. Then Linthicum would throw him over&mdash;he knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span>
Linthicum would throw him over. He uttered a small cry
like a tortured cat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I seen it in his eye yesterday,
when he let out on me an&#8217; said he was a-gettin&#8217; sick
of the business. I shed hev kept my mouth shut. I&#8217;d said
too much an&#8217; it made him mad. He&#8217;ll throw me over Monday
mornin&#8217; ef I don&#8217;t take him the money on Sunday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He ate nothing all through the day but lay waiting for
the passing of the hours. He had calculated as to which
post would bring the letter from Minty. He had written
to tell her of the hiding-place in which he had kept the bits
of paper safe and dry through all the years. She was to
enclose them in a stout envelope and send them to him.
</p>
<p>Through the long, dragging day he lay alone burning,
gasping, fighting for his breath in the attacks of coughing
which seemed to tear his lungs asunder. There was a clock
in a room below whose striking he could hear each hour.
Between each time it struck he felt as if weeks elapsed.
Sometimes it was months. He had begun to be light-headed
and to think queer things. Once or twice he heard
a man talking in a croaking wail, and after a few minutes
realised that it was himself, and that he did not know what
he had said, though he knew he had been arguing with
Linthicum, who was proving to him that his claim was too
rotten to have a ghost of a chance. By the time the afternoon
post arrived he was semi-delirious and did not know
how it happened that he at last found himself holding
Minty&#8217;s letter in his hand. He laughed hysterically when
he opened it. It was all right. There were the two yellowed
sheets of paper&mdash;small sheets, written close, and in a peculiar
hand. He had often studied the handwriting, and believed
if he had seen it again he should know it. It was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span>
small but strong and characteristic, though that was not
what he had called it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef I&#8217;d hed more time an&#8217; could hev worked it out
more&mdash;an&#8217; got him to write suthin&#8217; down&mdash;I could hev hed
more of a hold,&#8221; he said, plaintively, &#8220;but Linthicum
wouldn&#8217;t give me no time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The post arrived earlier than he had expected it, and
this gave him time to lie and fret and listen again for the
striking of the clock in the room downstairs. The waiting
became too long, and as his fever increased he became
insanely impatient and could not restrain himself. To lie
and listen for his visitor&#8217;s footsteps upon the stairs&mdash;to lie
until seven o&#8217;clock&mdash;if he did not come till then, would be
more than he could endure. That would give him too long
to think over what Linthicum would do if the whole sum
were not forthcoming&mdash;to think of the reasons why the
parson might make up his mind to treat the letters as if
they were worthless. He lay and gnawed his finger-nails
anew.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give nothin&#8217; for &#8217;em ef I was in his place,&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;Ef thar&#8217;d been anythin&#8217; in &#8217;em that proved
anythin&#8217; I should hev used &#8217;em long sence. But then I&#8217;m
a business man an&#8217; he&#8217;s a parson, an&#8217; doesn&#8217;t know nothin&#8217;
about the laws. But he might go to some man&mdash;say a man
like Linthicum&mdash;who could put him up to things. Good
Lord!&#8221; in a new panic, &#8220;he mayn&#8217;t come at all. He
might jest stay away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He became so overwrought by this agonising possibility
that instead of listening for the striking of the clock, he
began to listen for the sound of some passing footstep&mdash;the
footstep of someone passing by chance who might be sent
to the parson with a note. With intolerable effort and suffering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span>
he managed to drag himself up and get hold of a
piece of paper and a pencil to write the following lines:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The letters hes come. You&#8217;d as well come an&#8217; get &#8217;em.
Others will pay for &#8217;em ef ye don&#8217;t want &#8217;em yerself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His writing of the last sentence cheered his spirits. It
was a support to his small, ignorant cunning. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
think someone else is biddin&#8217; agen him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ef
there was two of &#8217;em biddin&#8217;, I could get most anythin&#8217; I
axed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After he had put the communication in an envelope he
dragged himself to the door almost bent double by the
stabbing pain in his side. Once there he sat down on the
floor to listen for footsteps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard work this yere,&#8221; he panted, shivering with
cold in spite of his fever, &#8220;but it&#8217;s better than a-lyin&#8217; thar
doin&#8217; nothin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At length he heard steps. They were the running,
stamping feet of a boy who whistled as he came.
</p>
<p>Stamps opened the door and whistled himself&mdash;a whistle
of summons and appeal. The boy, who was on his way
with a message to another room, hesitated a minute and
then came forward, staring at the sight of the little, undressed,
shivering man with his head thrust into the passage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hallo!&#8221; he said, &#8220;what d&#8217;yer want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Want ye to carry this yere letter to a man,&#8221; Stamps got
out hoarsely. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give ye a quarter. Will ye do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; And he took both note and money, still staring
at the abnormal object before him.
</p>
<p>When the messenger arrived Latimer was reading the
letters which had arrived by the last delivery. One of them
was from Baird, announcing the hour of his return to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span>
city. Latimer held it in his hand when Stamps&#8217;s communication
was brought to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell the messenger that I will come,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was not long before Stamps heard his slow approach
sounding upon the bare wooden stairs. He mounted the
steps deliberately because he was thinking. He was thinking
as he had thought on his way through the streets. In
a few minutes he should be holding in his hand letters
written by the man who had been Margery&#8217;s murderer&mdash;the
letters she had hidden and clung to and sobbed over in the
blackness of her nights. And they had been written twenty
years ago, and Margery had changed to dust on the hillside
under the pines. And nothing could be undone and
nothing softened. But for the sake of the little old woman
ending her days quietly in Willowfield&mdash;and for the sake
of Margery&#8217;s memory&mdash;yes, he wanted to save the child&#8217;s
memory&mdash;but for these things there would be no use in
making any effort to secure the papers. Yet he was conscious
of a dread of the moment when he should take them
into his hand.
</p>
<p>Stamps turned eager, miserable eyes upon him as he
came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought mebbe ye&#8217;d made up yer mind to let the
other feller hev them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hev ye brought the
money in bills?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer stood and looked down at him. &#8220;Do you know
how ill you are?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I guess I kin feel a right smart&mdash;but I don&#8217;t keer
so&#8217;s things comes my way. Hev ye got the money with ye?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Where are the papers?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_416' name='page_416'></a>416</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whar&#8217;s the money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer took out a pocket-book and opened it that he
might see.
</p>
<p>Stamps&#8217;s countenance relaxed. The tension was relieved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s far an&#8217; squar,&#8221; he said. &#8220;D&#8217;ye wanter know
whar I found &#8217;em? Tom Dwillerby never knowed I hed
more than a envelope&mdash;an&#8217; I tuk care not to tell him the
name that was writ on it. Ye was mighty smart never to
let no one know yer name; I don&#8217;t know how you done it,
&#8217;ceptin&#8217; that ye kept so much to yerselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer remained silent, merely standing and letting
him talk, as he seemed to have a feverish, half-delirious
tendency to do. He lay plucking at the scanty bed-covering
and chuckling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas five years arter the child was born,&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;I was ridin&#8217; through Blair&#8217;s Holler an&#8217; it come to me sudden
to go in an&#8217; hev a look round keerful. I looked keerful&mdash;mighty
keerful&mdash;an&#8217; at last I went on my hands an&#8217;
knees an&#8217; crawled round, an&#8217; there was a hole between the
logs, an&#8217; I seen a bit of white&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t hev seen it ef I
hadn&#8217;t been crawlin&#8217; an&#8217; looked up. An&#8217; I dug it out. It
hed been hid mighty secret.&#8221; He put his hand under his
wretched pillow. &#8220;Give me the money,&#8221; he wheezed.
&#8220;When ye lay it in my hand I&#8217;ll pass the envelope over to
ye. Count it out first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer counted the bills. This was the moment.
Twenty years gone by&mdash;and nothing could be changed. He
put the money on the bed.
</p>
<p>Stamps withdrew his hand from under the pillow. A
stout, ill-directed envelope was in its grasp and he passed
it over to Latimer. He was shivering and beginning to
choke a little, but he grinned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_417' name='page_417'></a>417</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckin&#8217; it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;D&#8217;ye want to read
&#8217;em now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Latimer answered, and putting them in his breast-pocket
walked out of the room.
</p>
<p>He passed down the stairs and into the avenue where the
lamps were lighted and which wore its usual somewhat deserted
evening air. He walked along quietly for some minutes.
He did not quite know where he was going. Having
left a line for Baird explaining his absence, he had time to
spare. If he wished to be alone, he could be so until the hour
of the beginning of the lecture. For certain reasons it would
be necessary that he should see Baird before he went upon
the platform. Yes, he must be alone. His mood required
it. He would go somewhere and look at the two yellowed
letters written twenty years ago. He did not know why it
was that he felt he must look at them, but he knew he must.
They would satisfy no curiosity if he felt it, and he had
none. Perhaps it was the old tragic tender feeling for
Margery which impelled him. Perhaps he unconsciously
longed to read that this man had loved her&mdash;that she had
not given her life for nothing&mdash;that the story had not
been one of common caprice and common treachery. As
he walked his varied thoughts surged through his brain disconnectedly.
Every now and then he involuntarily put his
hand to his breast-pocket to feel the envelope. Once there
crossed his mind a memory of the woman whose boy had
died and who dare not let herself recall him, and so be swept
back into the black maelstrom of woe. To-night, with
these things on his breast, it was not twenty years since he
had heard Margery&#8217;s dying cries&mdash;it was last night&mdash;last
night&mdash;and the odour of the pine-trees was in his nostrils&mdash;the
sough of their boughs in his ears.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_418' name='page_418'></a>418</span></p>
<p>He stopped near the entrance to the grounds of the
Smithsonian Institute. They were as secluded as a private
park at this time, but here and there was a seat and a light.
He turned in and found his way to the most retired part
where he could find these things&mdash;a bench to sit down on,
a light to aid him to read. He heard his own breathing as
he sat down; he felt the heavy, rapid pulsations of his
heart, as he took the papers from his breast his hand was
shaking, he could not hold it still. He took out more
papers than the envelope Stamps had given him. He drew
forth with this the letter which had arrived from Baird,
and which he had been reading when the messenger arrived.
He had abstractedly put it in his pocket. It fell
from his shaking hand upon the ground at his feet, and
he let it lie there, forgetful of its existence.
</p>
<p>Then he withdrew the two letters from the large envelope
and opened one of them.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>He read them through once&mdash;twice&mdash;three times&mdash;four.
Then he began again. He had read them a dozen times
before he closed them. He had read them word by word,
poring over each character, each turn of phrase, as a man
might pore over an enigma or a document written in a
foreign language of which he only knew stray words. If
his hands had shaken at first, he had not turned a page
before his whole body was shaking and his palms, his forehead,
his hair were damp with cold dew. He had uttered
one sharp, convulsed exclamation like a suffocated cry&mdash;then
he went on reading&mdash;reading&mdash;reading&mdash;and shuddering
as he read. They were not long letters, but after he
had read them once he understood them, and each time he
read them again he understood them better. Yes, he could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_419' name='page_419'></a>419</span>
translate them. They were the farewells of a man tossed by
a whirlwind of passionate remorseful grief. The child had
been loved&mdash;her very purity had been loved while she had
been destroyed and deceived. The writer poured forth
heart-sick longing and heart-sick remorse. He had not at
first meant to conceal from her that he was not a free man&mdash;then
he had lost control over his very being&mdash;and he had
lost his soul. When she had discovered the truth and had
not even reproached him but had stood silent&mdash;without a
word&mdash;and gazed at him with her childish, agonised, blue-flower
eyes&mdash;he had known that if men had souls his was
damned. There was no pardon&mdash;he could ask none&mdash;pardon
would not undo&mdash;death itself would not undo what he
had done. &#8220;Margery! Margery! Oh! child&mdash;God hear me
if there is God to hear&mdash;I loved you&mdash;I love you&mdash;Death
will not undo that either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was going abroad to join his wife. He spoke of the
ship he sailed on. Latimer knew its name and who had
sailed in it. In the second letter he besought her to let
him see and speak one word to her&mdash;but knew she would
not grant his prayer. He had seen her in the street, and
had not dared to approach. &#8220;I did not fear what a man
might fear from other women,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;I felt that it
might kill you, suddenly to see me near when you could
not escape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And after he had read it a third time Latimer realised a
ghastly truth. The man who wrote had gone away unknowing
of the blackness of the tragedy he had left behind.
He plainly had not known the secret Death itself
had helped to hide. Perhaps when he had gone Margery
herself had not known the worst.
</p>
<p>Latimer, having finished his reading, rested his head on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_420' name='page_420'></a>420</span>
his hand for a dull moment and stared down at the letter
lying upon the ground at his feet&mdash;the letter he had dropped
as he took out the others. He felt as if he had not strength
or inclination to pick it up&mdash;he had passed through a black
storm which had swept away from him the power to feel
more than a dull, heavy, physical prostration.
</p>
<p>But after a few minutes he stooped and picked the letter
up. He laid it on his knee by the other two and sat gazing
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not know,&#8221; he said, in a colourless voice. &#8220;I
told him. He heard it first from me when I told him how
she died.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The handwriting of the letters was Baird&#8217;s&mdash;every character
and word and phrase were his&mdash;Baird was the man
who had written them.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
</div>

<p>The street in which the lecture hall stood began to wear
the air of being a centre of interest some time before the
doors of the building were opened. People who had not
been able to obtain reserved seats wished to arrive early.
The lectures which had begun by being popular had ended
by being fashionable. At the outset an audience of sober,
religious tendencies had attended them, but after the first
one had been delivered other elements had presented themselves.
There had been a sprinkling of serious scientific
men, a prominent politician or so, some society women
whose faces and toilettes were well-known and lavishly described
in the newspapers. On this last night the audience
was largely of the fashionable political world. Carriages
drove up one after another and deposited well-dressed persons
who might have been expected that night to appear
at certain brilliant social functions, and who had come to
hear &#8220;Repentance&#8221; instead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has always had good audiences,&#8221; said a member of
the Committee of Arrangement, &#8220;but he has never had
one like this&mdash;in Washington at least. There is the Secretary
of State with his wife and daughter. I believe the
President is to be here. He has awakened an enormous interest.
The house will be literally crammed. They are
filling the aisle with seats already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird was in the small retiring-room which had been
arranged for his convenience. His journey had somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_422' name='page_422'></a>422</span>
fatigued him, and he was in the physical and mental condition
to feel glad that this lecture was to be the last of the
series. He was going back to Willowfield, though he was
not to remain there. He had received a call from an important
church in New York and had accepted it. He was
endeavouring to make arrangements that Latimer could be
near him. On his return this evening he had found a
letter he had been expecting. It referred to Latimer, and
he was anxious to talk it over with him. He wished he
would come in, and felt a little restless over his delay,
though he knew they would have time to say but few words
to each other before it was time for the lecture to begin.
He walked up and down the room looking down at the
green carpet and thinking, his thoughts wandering vaguely
to the little pursuant of the herd claim and the letters he
had wanted to deliver. He smiled faintly, remembering
the small frame in the over-large clothes and the bucolic
countenance with its over-sharpness of expression.
</p>
<p>The member of the committee looked into the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are beginning to turn people away from the
doors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Half the Cabinet is here&mdash;I never saw
such an audience.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he went away smiling, someone passed him in entering
the room. Baird, who was smiling also, changed his
expression of courteous appreciation to a smile of greeting,
for the man who had entered was Latimer.
</p>
<p>He advanced, holding out his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you have come,&#8221; he began to say. &#8220;I wanted
at least a word with you before I went on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then his smile died out, leaving blank amazement which
a breath&#8217;s space later was alarmed questioning. He recalled
later how for a second he stood and stared. Latimer&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_423' name='page_423'></a>423</span>
face was white and damp with sweat. Its lines were drawn
and sunken deep. His eyes were fixed on the man before
him with something which had a ghastly resemblance to
an unsteady smile which was not a smile at all. He looked
as if illness&mdash;or death&mdash;or madness had struck him. He
did not seem a sane man, and yet a stillness so deadly was
expressed by his whole being that it seemed to fill the small,
neat, business-like green-room.
</p>
<p>Baird strode towards him and seized him by the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? What is it? What is it?&#8221; he cried out.
</p>
<p>Latimer&#8217;s face did not alter in a line. He fumbled
stiffly in his breast-pocket and held out some pieces of
yellowed letter-paper&mdash;this being done stiffly, too. He
spoke in a hoarse whisper. It seemed to search every corner
of the room and echo there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; he said. &#8220;These are two letters. A man wrote
them to a poor, half-mad child twenty years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The door opened, and the member of the committee
looked in again, radiant with exultation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The audience waiting in such breathless silence that
you might hear a pin drop. Two thousand of them, if
there&#8217;s one. Ten minutes to eight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; answered Baird.
</p>
<p>The door closed again and he stood looking at Latimer&#8217;s
rigid hand and the papers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were written to Margery,&#8221; went on Latimer.
&#8220;Stamps found them in a chink in the logs. She had hidden
them there that she might take them out and sob over
and kiss them. I used to hear her in the middle of the
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird snatched them from his hand. He fell into a chair
near the table and dropped his face upon the yellowed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_424' name='page_424'></a>424</span>
fragments, pressing them against his lips with awful sobbing
sounds, as if he would wrest from them the kisses the
long-dead girl had left there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I, too!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I, too! Oh! my God! Margery!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say &#8216;God!&#8217;&#8221; said Latimer. &#8220;When she was dying,
in an agony of fear, she said it. Not that word! Another!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He said no other&mdash;and Latimer drew nearer to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wrote them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are written in your
hand&mdash;in your words&mdash;I should know them anywhere. You
may deny it. I could prove nothing. I do not want to
prove anything. Deny it if you will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird rose unsteadily. The papers were clutched in his
hand. His face was marred by the unnaturalness of a man&#8217;s
tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I shall deny it?&#8221; he answered. &#8220;It is
true. I have sat and listened to your talk of her and
thought I should go quite mad. You have told me of her
tortures, and I have listened. I did not know&mdash;surely she
did not know herself&mdash;of the child&mdash;when I went away. It
is no use saying to you&mdash;how should it be?&mdash;that I loved
her&mdash;that I was frenzied by my love of her innocent sweetness!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there is no use,&#8221; answered Latimer, in a voice actually
void of emotion, &#8220;but I daresay it is true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no use in calling myself by any of the names
invented for the men who bring about such tragedies. They
are true of some men perhaps, but they were not true of
me. I don&#8217;t know what was true of me. Something worse
than has ever been put into words perhaps, for I loved her
and I have loved her for twenty years. I would have given
up my career&mdash;my life, anything she had asked!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_425' name='page_425'></a>425</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But when she found you had acted a lie to her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed to fill her with the frantic terror of a child.
I dare not approach her. I think she thought she would
be struck dead by Heaven. Great God! how I understood
your story of her prayers. And it was I&mdash;it was I!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned on Latimer with a kind of ferocity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have crucified me!&#8221; he cried out. &#8220;Let that comfort
you. You have crucified me by her side, that I might
see her die&mdash;that I might hear her low little piteous voice&mdash;that
I might see her throes and terrors. And I love her&mdash;and
remember every look of her loving child&#8217;s eyes&mdash;every
curve and quiver of her mouth. Through all the years I
have been crucified, knowing I had earned all that I felt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Latimer moved across the room, putting the table between
them. He went and stood by the mantel. A murmur
of impatient applause from the audience came through
the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You loved her,&#8221; he said, standing with his hand holding
something in his breast. &#8220;And I loved you. She was
the one brightness of my life when I was a boy and you
were its one brightness when I was a man. You gave me
a reason for living. I am not the kind of man to be my
own reason. I needn&#8217;t tell you what you have been to me.
You were the one man on earth I dared to confess to. I
knew you would understand and that you knew what pity
was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird groaned aloud. He wiped the sweat from his forehead
with his handkerchief as he listened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you were the one man I could trust. I could
<i>trust</i> you. I could confide in you, and talk to you about
Margery. One day you said to me that you had learned to
love her and that we might have been brothers.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_426' name='page_426'></a>426</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When I was left free I had but one thought,&#8221; Baird
said, &#8220;to return to her&mdash;to atone, so far as atonement
could be&mdash;to pray of her upon my knees. But she was
dead&mdash;she was dead!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she was dead, and I had no one left to talk to
about her. You were my one comfort and support and
friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew his hand out of his breast. Baird started and
then stood quite quiet. The hand held a pistol.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to kill me?&#8221; he said. &#8220;You know I
asked you that once before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Latimer, &#8220;I am not going to kill you. I am
going to kill the man who loved you, and found you his
reason for living. It&#8217;s all done with!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! no!&#8221; shrieked Baird, and he hurled himself across
the table like a madman. &#8220;No! You are not! No, Latimer!
No! God! No!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were struggling together&mdash;Baird hung to his arm
and tried to drag the pistol from his grasp. But it was no
use; Latimer&#8217;s long, ill-hung limbs were the stronger. His
fixed face did not change, but he wrenched himself free
and flung Baird across the room. He set the pistol against
his heart and pulled the trigger. He gave something like
a leap and fell down.
</p>
<p>The door opened for the returning member of the committee
and the impatient applause of the audience came
through it almost a roar.
</p>
<p>Baird was struggling to rise as if his fall had stunned
him. Latimer was stretched at full length, quite dead.

<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>
</div>

<p>Tom walked up the staircase pondering deeply. The De
Willoughby claim was before the House. Judge Rutherford
was making his great speech, and the chief claimant
might have been expected to be sitting breathless in one of
the galleries. But he was not. He was going to Baird,
who had sent for him, and Baird was sitting in the room in
which Latimer lay dead with a bullet in his heart. He had
been sitting there for hours, and when Tom had arrived
at the house he had been told that Baird had asked that he
should be taken to him in the death-chamber. He was
sitting on a chair by the bed on which Latimer was stretched,
rigid with a still face, which looked like a mask of yellow
wax, appearing above the exceeding freshness of the turned-down
linen sheet. Baird did not move as Tom entered, but
continued to gaze at the dread thing with dull, drooping
eyes. Tom went to him and laid his hand on his shoulder.
He saw the man was stupefied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to say, Baird,&#8221; he said after a silence,
&#8220;when it comes to this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something for me to say,&#8221; Baird answered,
very quietly. &#8220;I want to say it before him, while he lies
there. I wonder if he will hear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He may.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would not do any good to anyone if he did,&#8221; Baird
said. &#8220;The blackness of it all lies in that&mdash;that he would
not be helped, she would not be helped&mdash;I should not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She?&#8221; said Tom.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_428' name='page_428'></a>428</span></p>
<p>Baird got up at once, stiffly and unsteadily. He stood
upright, the lithe-limbed slender form, which was so much
admired upon the platform, held rigidly. His face looked
lined and haggard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No other man shall feel an affection for me&mdash;I think
you are beginning to feel an affection for me&mdash;under a
false impression. That man loved me for long years, and
I loved him. I think I helped him to something that was
as near happiness as his nature would allow him to feel.
God knows I owed it to him. I was one of those who repented
too late. That is why I have preached of repentance.
I have done it with a secret, frenzied hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he know your reason?&#8221; asked Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until last night. When he knew it, he killed himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;?&#8221; began Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he had loved and trusted me for half a lifetime&mdash;because
I was the one human creature to whom he
had confided the tragedy of his life&mdash;knowing he would
be sure of comprehension and sympathy. It was to me he
poured forth the story of that poor child. You saw her
die. She was his sister. And I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom turned and looked at the face of the dead man and
then, slowly, to the face of the living one, who stood before
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;were the man?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom turned to the dead man again. He put his big,
warm hand with a curiously suggestive movement&mdash;a
movement somehow suggesting protection&mdash;upon the stiff,
clasped fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, poor fellow!&#8221; he said, as if speaking to him. &#8220;You&mdash;no,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_429' name='page_429'></a>429</span>
no, there was nothing but this&mdash;for you. God have
mercy on us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Baird, &#8220;there was nothing else for him. I
know that. Everything was whirled away. I had hours
last night thinking there is nothing else for me. Perhaps
there is not. But first I shall take his body back to his
mother. I must tell her lies. This is the result of an accident.
That is what I shall tell her. She is a little old
woman who will not live long. I must take care of her&mdash;and
let her talk to me about her son who loved me&mdash;and
her daughter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He began to walk up and down the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A man does not live&mdash;for fifteen years&mdash;side by side
with another&mdash;that other loving him wholly&mdash;and see the
blackness of his own deed laid bare&mdash;and hear again and
again of the woe he has wrought&mdash;he does not live so in
peace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you&mdash;&#8221; wildly&mdash;&#8220;I tell you there have been hours&mdash;as
he has talked to me of her&mdash;when the cold sweat has
stood upon my flesh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He came back to Tom. He was frantic with agonised
restlessness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In all the cruelty of it,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;there seems to have
been one human pitying soul. It was yours. You were
tender to her in those last hours. You were merciful&mdash;you
held her hand when she died.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tom, in a somewhat husky voice, since he
remembered it so well, &#8220;she was frightened. Her little
hand was cold. I took it in mine and told her not to be
afraid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird flung out his own hand with a movement of passionate
feeling&mdash;then let it fall at his side.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_430' name='page_430'></a>430</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We shall not meet again,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you will not want
to see me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Big Tom gave him a long, steady look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord, man!&#8221; he said, after it, &#8220;am I the man to
judge another? <i>I</i>&#8217;ve made nothing of life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have done no creature a wrong,&#8221; Baird said. &#8220;And
you have helped some to happiness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; admitted Big Tom, &#8220;perhaps that&#8217;s true. But
I&#8217;ve been a lumbering failure myself. I&#8217;ve just judgment
enough now to know that there&#8217;s nothing a man can say
about a thing like this&mdash;nothing&mdash;and just sense enough
not to try to say it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you go back to North Carolina,&#8221; asked Baird, &#8220;may
I come to see you&mdash;and to see her? She need never know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t want her to know,&#8221; Tom answered, &#8220;but
you may come. We shall go back, and I intend to let those
two young ones set up a Garden of Eden of their own. It
will be a good thing to look on at. Yes, you may come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is mercifulness,&#8221; said Baird, and this time when
he put out his hand he did not withdraw it, and Tom gave
it a strong, sober clasp which expressed more than one
emotion.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When Tom returned to the little house near Dupont
Circle, Uncle Matt wore a rigidly repressed air as he opened
the door, and Miss Burford stood in the hall as if waiting
for something. Her ringlets were shaken by a light tremor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have either won the claim this afternoon or lost it,&#8221;
Tom said to himself, having glanced at both of them and
exchanged the usual greeting.
</p>
<p>They had won it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_431' name='page_431'></a>431</span></p>
<p>Judge Rutherford was striding up and down the sitting-room,
but it was Sheba who was deputed to tell the news.
</p>
<p>She did it in a little scene which reminded him of her
childhood. She drew him to a chair and sat down on his
knee, clasping both slim, tender arms round his neck, tears
suddenly rushing into her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You and Rupert are rich men, Uncle Tom, darling,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;The claim has passed. You are rich. You
need never be troubled about mortgages again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was conscious of a tremendous shock of relief. He
folded her in his arms as if she had been a baby.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank the Lord!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I should
be so glad of it.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
</div>

<p>The unobtrusive funeral cortége had turned the corner
of Bank Street and disappeared from view almost an hour
ago. In the front room of the house in which had lived
the man just carried to his grave, the gentle old woman
who had been his mother sat and looked with pathetic
patience at Miss Amory Starkweather as the rough winds
of the New England early spring rushed up the empty
thoroughfare and whirled through the yet unleafed trees.
Miss Amory had remained after the other people had gone
away, and she was listening to the wind, too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are both old women,&#8221; she had said. &#8220;We have
both lived long enough to have passed through afternoons
like this more than once before. Howsoever bad other hours
may be, it seems to me that these are always the worst.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just after&mdash;everything&mdash;has been taken away,&#8221; Mrs.
Latimer said now; &#8220;the house seems so empty. Faith,&#8221;
tremulously, &#8220;even Faith can&#8217;t help you not to feel that
everything has gone&mdash;such a long, long way off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She did not wipe away the tear that fell on her cheek.
She looked very small and meek in her deep mourning. She
presented to Miss Amory&#8217;s imagination the figure of a lovable
child grown old without having lost its child temperament.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must not complain,&#8221; she went on, with an effort
to smile at Miss Amory&#8217;s ugly old intelligently sympathetic
countenance. &#8220;It must have been all over in a second,
and he could have felt no pain at all. Death by accident
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_433' name='page_433'></a>433</span>
is always an awful shock to those left behind; but it must
scarcely be like death to&mdash;those who go. He was quite
well; he had just bought the pistol and took it out to
show to Mr. Baird. Mr. Baird himself did not understand
how it happened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nearly always so&mdash;that no one quite sees how
it is done,&#8221; Miss Amory answered. &#8220;Do not let yourself
think of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was sitting quite near to Mrs. Latimer, and she leaned
forward and put her hand over the cold, little, shrivelled
one lying on the lap of the mourning-dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Though it was so sudden,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it was an end
not unlike Margery&#8217;s&mdash;the slipping out of life without realising
that the last hour had come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I have thought that, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked up at the portrait on the wall&mdash;the portrait
of the bright girl-face. Her own face lighted into a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so strange to think that they are together again,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;They will have so much to tell each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Amory; &#8220;yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She got up herself and went and stood before the picture.
Mrs. Latimer rose and came and stood beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Baird has been with me every day,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He
has been like a son to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A carriage drew up before the house, and, as the occupant
got out, both women turned to look.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Latimer turned a shade paler.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have got back from the funeral,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It
is Mr. Baird.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then came the ring at the front door, the footsteps in
the passage, and Baird came into the room. He was haggard
and looked broken and old, but his manner was very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_434' name='page_434'></a>434</span>
gentle when he went to the little old woman and took
her hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he scarcely knew he had so many friends at
Janney&#8217;s Mills,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A great many of them came.
When I turned away the earth was covered with flowers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew her to a chair and sat by her. She put her
white head on his arm and cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was always so sad,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He thought people
never cared for him. But he was good&mdash;he was good. I
felt sure they must love him a little. It will be better for
him&mdash;<i>now</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Amory spoke from her place before the fire, where
she stood rigidly, with a baffled look on her face. Her
voice was low and hoarse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, with eager pitifulness. &#8220;It will be
better now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little mother lifted her wet face, still clinging to
Baird&#8217;s arm as she looked up at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I have it to remember,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;that you&mdash;<i>you</i>
were his friend, and that for years you made him
happier than he had ever been. He said you gave him
a reason for living.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird was ashen pale. She stooped and softly kissed the
back of his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somehow,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you seemed even to comfort him
for Margery. He seemed to bear it better after he knew
you. I shall not feel as if they were quite gone away from
me while I can talk to you about them. You will spare
an hour now and then to come and sit with me?&#8221; She
looked round the plain, respectable little room with a quiet
finality. &#8220;I am too old and tired to live long,&#8221; she added.
</p>
<p>It was Baird who kissed her hand now, with a fervour
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_435' name='page_435'></a>435</span>
almost passion. Miss Amory started at sight of his action,
and at the sound of the voice in which he spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to me as you would have talked to him,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Think of me as you would have thought of him. Let
me&mdash;in God&#8217;s name, let me do what there is left me!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Miss Amory&#8217;s carriage had waited before the gate, and
when she went out to it Baird went with her.
</p>
<p>After he had put her into it he stood a moment on the
pavement and looked at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to come with you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;May I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, and made room for him at her
side.
</p>
<p>But he took the seat opposite to her and leaned back,
shutting his eyes while Miss Amory&#8217;s rested upon him.
The life and beauty which had been such ever-present characteristics
of his personality seemed to have left him never
to return. Miss Amory&#8217;s old nerves were strung taut. She
had passed through many phases of feeling with regard to
him as the years had gone by. During those years she
had believed that she knew a hidden thing of him known
by no other person. She had felt herself a sort of silent
detective in the form of an astute old New England gentlewoman.
She had abhorred and horribly pitied him.
She had the clear judicial mind which must inevitably see
the tragic pitifulness of things. She had thought too much
to be able to indulge in the primitive luxury of unqualified
condemnation. As she watched him to-day during their
drive through the streets, she realised that she beheld a
kind of suffering not coming under the head of any ordinary
classification. It was a hopeless, ghastly thing, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_436' name='page_436'></a>436</span>
breaking up of life, a tearing loose of all the cords to which
a man might anchor his existence.
</p>
<p>When they reached the house and entered the parlour,
she went to her chair and sat down&mdash;and waited. She
knew she was waiting, and believed she knew what for.
In a vague way she had always felt that an hour like this
would come to them. They were somehow curiously akin.
Baird began to walk to and fro. His lips were trembling.
Presently he turned towards the rigid figure in the chair
and stood still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not an accident,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He killed himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I felt sure of,&#8221; Miss Amory answered. &#8220;Tell
me why he did it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baird began to tremble a little himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I must. I suppose&mdash;there is
a sort of hysteric luxury in&mdash;confession. He did it because
there was nothing else left. The foundations of his world
had been torn from under his feet. Everything was gone.&#8221;
His voice broke into a savage cry. &#8220;Oh! in one short lifetime&mdash;the
black misery a man can bring about!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Amory.
</p>
<p>He threw himself into a chair near her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For years&mdash;years,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he hid a secret.&#8221;
Miss Amory bent forward. She felt she must help him
a little&mdash;for pity&#8217;s sake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it the secret of Margery?&#8221; she half whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When a woman has spent a long life alone, thinking&mdash;thinking,&#8221;
she answered, &#8220;she has had time to learn to
observe and to work at problems. The day she fainted in
the street and I took her home in my carriage, I began
to fear&mdash;to guess. She was not only a girl who was ill&mdash;she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_437' name='page_437'></a>437</span>
was a child who was being <i>killed</i> with some horror;
she was heart-breaking. I used to go and see her. In
the end I knew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;did not,&#8221; he said, looking at her with haggard eyes.
</p>
<p>There was a long pause. She knew he had told her all
in the one sentence&mdash;all she had guessed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not know I knew,&#8221; she went on, presently.
&#8220;She believed no one knew. Oh, I tell you again, she was
heart-breaking! She did not know that there were wild
moments when she dropped words that could be linked
into facts and formed into a chain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had you formed it,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;when you wrote and
told me she had died?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It had led me to you&mdash;to nothing more. I felt
death had saved her from what would have been worse. It
seemed as if&mdash;the blackest devil&mdash;would be glad to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the blackest devil, perhaps,&#8221; he said, with stony
helplessness, &#8220;but when I received your letter I was grovelling
on my knees praying that I might get back to her&mdash;and
atone&mdash;as far as a black devil could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And she was <i>dead</i>,&#8221; said Miss Amory, wringing her
hands together on her lap; &#8220;dead&mdash;dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly and turned on him. &#8220;He killed
himself,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;because he found out that it was
<i>you</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I was the one man he loved&mdash;he had told his
secret to me&mdash;to <i>me!</i>&mdash;the black devil. Now&mdash;now I must
go to his mother, day after day, and be her son&mdash;because
I was his friend&mdash;and knew his love for Margery&mdash;and of
her sweetness&mdash;and her happy, peaceful death. He used
to talk to me for hours; she&mdash;poor, tender soul&mdash;will talk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_438' name='page_438'></a>438</span>
to me again&mdash;of Margery&mdash;Margery&mdash;Margery&mdash;and of Lucien,
whose one happiness I was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will&mdash;almost&mdash;be&mdash;enough,&#8221; said Miss Amory,
slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;it will almost be enough&mdash;even
for a black devil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he turned on his chair and laid his face on his
folded arms and sobbed like a woman.

<h2>CHAPTER XLII</h2>
</div>

<p>The springtime sunshine had been smiling upon Talbot&#8217;s
Cross-roads all the day. It was not hot, but warm, and its
beauty was added to by the little soft winds which passed
through the branches of the blossoming apple and pear
trees and shook the fragrance from them. The brown earth
was sweet and odorous, as it had been on the Sunday morning
Sheba had knelt and kissed it, and the garden had
covered itself, as then, with hyacinths and daffodils and
white narcissus.
</p>
<p>During the last weeks the Cross-roads had existed in
something like a state of delirium. People rode in from
the mountains and returned to their homes after hours
of conversation, semi-stupefied with enjoyment. Tom
D&#8217;Willerby had won his claims. After months of mystified
discouragement, in which the Cross-roads seemed to
have lost him in a vague and distant darkness, life had
seemed to begin again. Nobody was sufficiently analytical
of mind to realise in what measure big Tom D&#8217;Willerby had
been the centre of the community, which was scattered over
miles of mountain road and wood and clearing. But when
he had disappeared many things seemed to melt away with
him. In fact, a large, shrewd humanity was missing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be doggered,&#8221; had been a remark of Mr. Doty&#8217;s
in the autumn, &#8220;ef crops hes done es well sence he went.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There had been endless talk of the villanous tendencies
of Government officials, and of the tricks played whose
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_440' name='page_440'></a>440</span>
end was to defraud honest and long-suffering claimants of
their rights. There had even been dark hours when it
had seemed possible that the vitiating effect of Washington
life might cause deterioration in the character of even the
most upright. Could Tom himself stand it, and what would
be its effect on Sheba?
</p>
<p>But when the outlook was the most inauspicious,
Fortune&#8217;s wheel had swept round once and all was
changed.
</p>
<p>A letter brought the news&mdash;a simple enough letter from
Tom himself. The claim was won. They were coming
back to Hamlin County, he and Sheba and Rupert De
Willoughby. Sheba and Rupert were to be married and
spend the first weeks of their honeymoon on the side of
the mountain which had enclosed the world the child
Sheba had first known.
</p>
<p>On this particular day every man and woman who had
known and played with her appeared at the Cross-roads.
There had not been a large number of them perhaps, but
gathered together at and about the Post-office and about
the house and garden, they formed a crowd, as crowds
are counted in scattered communities. They embodied excitement
enough to have exhilarated a much larger body
of people. Half a dozen women had been helping Aunt
Mornin for days. The house wore a gala air, and the
cellar was stored with offerings of cake and home-made
luxuries. The garden was a mass of radiant scented bloom
of spring. Mis&#8217; Doty sat at the open window of the kitchen
and, looking out on nodding daffodils, apple-blossom, and
pink peach-flower warmed in the sun, actually chuckled
as she joyfully sniffled the air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The way them things smells,&#8221; she said, &#8220;an&#8217; the hummin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_441' name='page_441'></a>441</span>
o&#8217; them bees goin&#8217; about as ef the world hadn&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
but flowers an&#8217; honey in it, seems like it was all jest got
up for them two young uns. Lordy, I do declar&#8217;, it&#8217;s a
plum sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That bin a heap got up for &#8217;em, seems like,&#8221; said
Molly Hollister, smiling at the nearest apple-tree as if it
were a particular friend. &#8220;Fust off, they&#8217;re dead in love
with each other, an&#8217; we uns all knows how that makes
people feel&mdash;even in the dead o&#8217; winter, an&#8217; when they
ain&#8217;t a penny in their pockets; they&#8217;re as good-hearted
as they kin be&mdash;an&#8217; es hansum&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; they&#8217;re rich, an&#8217; they
was married this mornin&#8217;, an&#8217; they&#8217;re comin&#8217; home with
Tom D&#8217;Willerby to a place an&#8217; folks that loves &#8217;em&mdash;an&#8217;
the very country an&#8217; the things that grows seems as if
they was dressed out for a weddin&#8217;. An&#8217; it&#8217;s Sheba as
Tom took me to look at lyin&#8217; in her little old wooden
cradle in the room behind the store.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed, as she said it, a little hysteric laugh, with
suddenly moist eyes. She was an emotional creature.
</p>
<p>The road had been watched steadily for many hours before
any arrival could have been legitimately expected. It
gave restless interest&mdash;something to do. At noon one of
Molly Hollister&#8217;s boys came running breathlessly up the
road, waving his hat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a-comin&#8217;!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;They&#8217;re a-comin&#8217;!
They&#8217;re in a fine carriage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let Tom D&#8217;Willerby alone for havin&#8217; the finest team
in Hamlin,&#8221; said Mr. Doty, with a neighbourly grin.
</p>
<p>Almost immediately the carriage was to be seen. The
horses lifted their feet high, and stepped at a pace which
was felt worthy of the occasion. Uncle Matt drove. Rupert
and Sheba sat side by side. They looked very young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_442' name='page_442'></a>442</span>
and beautiful, and rather shy. They had only been married
a few hours, and were bewildered by the new radiance of
things. Big Tom humanely endeavoured not to look at
them, but found it difficult to avert his eyes for any length
of time. There was that about them which drew his gaze
back in spite of himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s old Tom!&#8221; he heard familiar voices proclaim,
as they drew near the Post-office. &#8220;Howdy,
Tom! Howdy, Sheby! Wish ye much joy! Wish ye much
joy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the horses stopped, and the crowd of long-known
faces surged near and were all about the carriage. The
clamour of the greeting voices, the grasping of one hand
after another seemed to Sheba and Rupert like something
happening in a dream. They were too far away from
earth to feel it real just now, though it was part of the
happiness of things&mdash;like the sunshine and the soft wind
and the look in Tom&#8217;s eyes, when, amid hand-shakes
and congratulations, and welcoming laughter, he himself
laughed back in his old way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye look jest like ye used ter, Tom&mdash;jest like ye used
ter,&#8221; cried Jake Doty. &#8220;Ye hain&#8217;t changed a durned bit!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>How did the day pass? Who knows? What does it matter?
It was full of strange beauty, and strange happiness,
and strange life for two young souls at least. People came
and went, congratulating, wondering, rejoicing. Talbot&#8217;s
Cross-roads felt that it had vicariously come into the possession
of wealth and dignity of position. Among the
many visitors, Mrs. Stamps rode up on a clay-bank mare.
She was attired in the black calico riding-skirt and sunbonnet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_443' name='page_443'></a>443</span>
which represented the mourning garb of the mountain
relict.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a widder,&#8221; she said to big Tom, in a tone not unresigned.
&#8220;Ye got yer claim through, but Stamps hadn&#8217;t
no influence, an&#8217; he was took off by pneumony. Ketched
cold runnin&#8217; to Linthicum, I guess. His landlady was a
honest enough critter. She found a roll o&#8217; five hundred
dollars hid in his bed when she went to lay him out, an&#8217;
she sent it back to me. Lord knows whar he got it from&mdash;I
don&#8217;t. But it come in mighty handy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By sunset the welcoming crowd had broken up and
melted away into the mountains. Horses and ox-waggons
had been mounted and ridden or driven homeward. The
Post-office was closed; no one was to be seen in the porch.
No one was to be seen anywhere except in the garden among
the blossoms where Rupert and Sheba walked under the
fragrance of the trees, talking to each other in low, softly
broken words.
</p>
<p>Tom sat in the porch and watched the moon rise in
a sea of silver. The scents the wind wafted to him, the
occasional sound of a far-off night-bird, the rustle of the
leaves brought things back to him&mdash;things he had felt in
his youth. There had been nights like this in the days
when he had been a big, clumsy young fellow, wild with
hopeless love for Delia Vanuxem. On such nights the air
had been full of this night breath of flowers, the birds had
stirred in their nests with just such sounds, the moon had
mounted, as it did to-night, higher and higher in a sky
it thrilled a man&#8217;s soul to lift his face to.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was all like this,&#8221; he said, leaning back and
clasping his big hands behind his head. &#8220;Just like this!
And those two out there are living it over again, only they&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_444' name='page_444'></a>444</span>
been fairly treated, and they are trembling with the joy
of it. They&#8217;re pretty safe,&#8221; he ended. &#8220;They&#8217;re pretty
safe. They&#8217;ve had a fair show.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rupert and Sheba walked slowly side by side. They saw
and felt everything. If a bird stirred with a sleepy sound,
they stopped to listen and smiled tremulously at each other.
More than once Sheba knelt down and hid her face among
the flowers, kissing them. Her arms were full of white
blossoms. She and Rupert had made white garlands for
her hair and waist, such as she had worn the night he had
first seen her standing on her little balcony. When Rupert
held her to his side, the scent from their crushed petals
filled the air they breathed. The early night was at its
stillest and fairest, and the moonlight seemed to flood all
the world, when Sheba stopped and looked up, speaking
softly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we go now?&#8221; she said. &#8220;The moon will be shining
down between the pines. It will be so quiet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Let us go now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had planned weeks ago the things they were going
to do. They were going to say good-night to the small
mound at Blair&#8217;s Hollow.
</p>
<p>When they left their horses at the foot of the hill even
the pines could not look darkly under the fair light. The
balmy air passing through their branches made a sound
as if it was hushing a child to sleep.
</p>
<p>The little mound lay in the soft brightness of clear moonbeams.
Sheba knelt beside it and began to lay her bridal
blossoms on the grass-covered earth. Rupert stood and
watched her. His heart beat with a reverent, rapturous
tremor. She looked like a young angel.
</p>
<p>She bent down and laid her cheek upon the grass; her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_445' name='page_445'></a>445</span>
arm was thrown out as if she clasped something to her
girl&#8217;s breast. She spoke in a whisper&mdash;thrilled with love.
&#8220;I am happy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am happy. Oh, do you hear?
Do you hear?&#8221;
</p>
